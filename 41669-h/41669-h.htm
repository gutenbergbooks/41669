<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_NOTES" id="INTRODUCTORY_NOTES">INTRODUCTORY NOTES</a></h2>


<p>Through the author's handicraft volumes, and magazine and
newspaper articles, thousands of boys and girls who never realized
they could make their own toys, have succeeded in constructing
models which would do credit to Santa Claus' master
toy-makers.</p>

<p>The success of this new home industry has suggested the
need of a volume devoted entirely to toy-making, and in <span class="smcap">Home-made
Toys for Girls and Boys</span> the author has brought
together a large number of the toy ideas from his former
handicraft volumes, and from his articles published in the
<i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, <i>Woman's Home Companion</i>, <i>Good Housekeeping</i>,
the <i>Boys' Magazine</i>, and other publications, and he believes
that as collected and arranged the material will be found
a veritable gold-mine of toy-making information.</p>

<p>Go to any toy store and price the toys similar to those described
within these covers, then estimate if you can how much
the other toys you do not find would cost if manufactured, and
you will discover that one hundred dollars would not cover
their value. One splendid thing about these home-made toys
is that the greater part of them require little more than the
pick-up material found at home. Few boys and girls are given
a one hundred dollar assortment of toys at a time, yet any one
can own a collection of this value who is willing to spend the
time necessary to follow the instructions given in this book.
Probably, though, some of the toys will be wanted now, and
the others one, two or three seasons hence, because, you see,
the book is an all-the-year-round handy book with suggestions
for every season. Some of the toys will be of especial interest
to boys, yet girls who like what boys like will enjoy making
them also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Home-made toys are generally longer lived than store toys
because the boy or girl who expends a certain amount of effort
producing gives them better care. Home-made toys have a
greater value than boughten ones because there is as much
fun making them as playing with them. Doing something
interesting, getting satisfying results out of the work, putting
an idea into tangible form, and having a toy to show of which
it can be said, "I made this all myself,"&mdash;these are the factors
in toy-making so fascinating to boys and girls.</p>

<p>It is no less a child's nature to want to do that which is
most pleasing to him, than an adult's, so why not encourage
this wholesome activity of toy-making to which the child takes
as readily as a duck takes to water? It trains the mind to
think clearly, the hands to work cleverly, replaces destructive
thoughts with constructive ideas, and, in making the boy or
girl dependent upon himself or herself for toys, is invaluable
in developing resourcefulness.</p>

<p>Recognizing how easily the child's interest is attracted and
held by anything of a building nature, toy manufacturers have
placed scores of so-called "construction sets" upon the market,
but, though excellent as these outfits are, the toys they form
are merely assembled, not really made by the boy or girl, and
much of the value of making is lost. Exactly as good models
as those assembled with "construction sets" can be made of
pick-up materials, as chapters in this book show. In fact, some
of the models in the manufacturers' instruction pamphlets&mdash;merry-go-rounds,
Ferris wheels and swings&mdash;are almost identical
with home-made models devised long ago by the author
for his readers. Furthermore, there are many, very many toys
in <span class="smcap">Home-made Toys for Girls and Boys</span> which are beyond
the limited possibilities of "construction sets."</p>

<p>No mechanical toy is more interesting to make, nor more interesting to
watch in operation, than a miniature windmill. It is a very simple toy
to construct, and the material for making one can usually be found at
hand, which are two reasons why nearly every boy and girl at one time or
another builds one.</p>

<p><b>The Paper Pinwheel</b> shown in <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a> is one of the best whirlers
ever devised. A slight forward thrust of the stick handle upon which
it is mounted starts it in motion, and when you run with the stick
extended in front of you it whirls at a merry speed.</p>

<p>A piece of paper 8 or 10 inches square is needed for the
pinwheel. Fold this piece of paper diagonally from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
corner to corner, both ways. Then open the paper, and
with a pair of scissors cut along
the diagonal creases, from the
corners to within &frac12; inch of the
center (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). Next, fold corners
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i> over to the
center, as shown in <a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, run a
pin through the corners and
through the center of the sheet
of paper, drive the point of this
pin into the end of the stick
handle, and the pinwheel will be completed.</p>

<p><b>The Pinion-wheel Windmill</b> in <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a> may be made of cardboard or tin. A
circular piece 10 or 12 inches in diameter is required. After marking
out the outer edge with a compass, describe an inner circle about 1 inch
inside of it; then draw two lines through the center at right angles to
each other, and another pair at an angle of 45 degrees to these. These
lines are shown by the heavy radial lines in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
One-half inch from each of these lines draw a parallel line, as
indicated by dotted lines in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. The next thing to do is to cut out
the disk, and cut along the heavy lines just as far as the lines are
shown in the diagram (<a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>), and then to bend up the blades thus
separated, to an angle of about 45 degrees, bending on the second set of
radial lines (dotted lines in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>You had better make a cardboard pinion-wheel first, then a tin one
afterwards, as cardboard is so much easier to cut. A pair of heavy
shears will be necessary for cutting a tin wheel, and a cold chisel for
separating the edges of the blades.</p>

<p><b>To Mount the Pinion-wheel</b> drive a long nail through the center, through

<p><b>The Four-blade Windmill</b> shown in <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a> has a hub 4 inches in diameter
and 1 inch thick (<a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>). This should be cut out of hard wood. Draw two
lines across one face, through the center, and at right angles to each
other. Then carry these lines across the edge of the block, not at right
angles to the sides, but at an angle of 45 degrees. Saw along these
lines to a depth of 1&frac14; inches. The ends of the windmill blades
are to fit in these slots.</p>

<p>Cut the blades of equal size, 9 inches long, 5 inches wide on the wide
edge, and 1&frac12; inches wide on the narrow edge, and fasten them in
the slots with nails.</p>

</div>

<p>With the blades in position, pivot the hub to the end of the windmill
shaft, a stick 20 inches long (<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). The end opposite to that to
which the hub is pivoted is whittled round, and slotted with a saw to
receive a tail (<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>). The tail may be of the same size as the blades,
though it is shown shorter in the illustration.</p>

<p><b>Mount the Windmill</b> upon a post, pivoting its shaft at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the balancing center with a nail or screw. Bore a
hole large enough so the shaft will turn freely upon
the pivot, and the windmill will thus keep headed into
the wind.</p>

<p><b>The Eight-blade Windmill</b> in <a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a> has a spool hub
(<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>), and blades made of cigar-box wood, shingles,
tin, or cardboard (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). You will see by <a href="#fig_10">Figs. 10</a> and
<a href="#fig_11">11</a> that the blades are nailed to the side of short spoke
sticks, and the sticks are driven into holes bored in
the spool hub. The hub turns on the rounded end
of the shaft stick (<a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>), and the square end of
this shaft is slotted to receive the fan-shaped tail
(<a href="#fig_12">Figs. 12</a> and <a href="#fig_13">13</a>).</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE KITES</h3>


<p>The Malay tailless kite is probably the most practical
kind ever invented. It will fly in a wind that the tail
variety could not withstand, and it will fly in a breeze too
light to carry up most other forms of kites. It is also a
strong pulling kite, and can be used for sending aloft lanterns
and flags. For the purpose of lifting, the pulling
strength can be doubled by flying two Malays in tandem.</p>

<p><b>How to Make a Malay.</b> <a href="#fig_17">Figure 17</a> shows a Malay kite
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

the completed framework, and <a href="#fig_20">Figs. 20</a>, <a href="#fig_21">21</a>, and <a href="#fig_22">22</a> the
details for preparing the frame sticks.</p>

<p><b>The Sticks.</b> This kite has a vertical stick and a bow-stick,
each of which should be 40 inches long, about &frac34;
inch wide, and <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick, for a kite of medium size.
In the cutting of the sticks lies half the secret of making a
kite that will fly successfully.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Completed Malay Kite with Belly-band Attached.</p>
</div>

<p>Drive a small nail or large tack into each end
of the two sticks, to fasten the framing-string
to (<a href="#fig_20">Figs. 20</a> and <a href="#fig_21">21</a>), and notch the side
edges of the bow-stick near each end for the
attachment of the bow-string
(<a href="#fig_21">Figs. 21</a> and <a href="#fig_22">22</a>).</p>

<p>The amount to bend the bow-stick is important. For a kite with a bow 40
inches long the distance between the string and stick should be 6 inches
(<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>). Use a strong twine for the bow-string, and tie it securely to
the notched ends.</p>

<p><b>Framing the Sticks.</b> Fasten the bow-stick at its exact
center to the vertical stick, placing it 4 inches down from
the top of the vertical stick, as indicated in <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>. Drive
a couple of brads through the two sticks to hold them
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
together, and then reinforce the connection by wrapping
the joint with strong linen thread, crossing the thread in
the manner shown.</p>

</div>

<p>When the two sticks have been joined, connect their ends with the
framing-string. Stretch this string from stick to stick, and tie
securely to the end nails. Instead of the end nails, the sticks may be
notched to receive the framing-string, but the nails are more
satisfactory because the string can be tied fast to them and will not
slip.</p>

<p><b>Covering the Framework.</b> The strong light-weight brown wrapping-paper now
so generally used makes an excellent covering for the framework. A few
sheets can be purchased at a near-by store for the purpose. You will
likely have to paste together two or more sheets to make one large
enough. The paper should be placed on the outer face of the bow-stick,
and should be allowed a little fullness instead of being stretched tight
as on hexagonal tail kites. Lap the edges of the paper over the
framing-string in the ordinary way of covering a kite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Attach the Bridle</b> at the intersection of the bow-stick and vertical
stick, and at the lower end of the vertical stick (<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>), and make it
of the right length so when held over to one side it will reach to the
end of the bow, as indicated in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. Tie the flying line securely at
the point <i>A</i> (<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>); then the kite will be ready for its maiden
flight.</p>

<p><b>Flying-Line.</b> The kind of cord which a mason uses for his plumb-lines is
splendid for flying the Malay kite. If you cannot get some balls of
this, be certain that what you do get can be relied upon, because it is
provoking to lose a kite which you have taken a great deal of pains in
making, through the breaking of the flying line.</p>

<p><b>The Box-kite.</b> Of the more pretentious kites, none is as popular as the
rectangular box-kite.</p>

<p>Box-kites may be purchased ready-made in a number of
sizes, but they are not cheap, and it will pay any boy to
take the time necessary to make one. While their construction
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
requires considerable more work than the single-plane
type of kite, it is not difficult.</p>

<p><b>The Kite Sticks</b>, though any strong, light-weight wood of straight grain
may be used if easier to obtain. If you live near a lumber yard or
planing-mill, possibly you can get strips of just the size you require
from the waste heap, for the mere asking, or for a few cents get them
ripped out of a board. If not, you will find it easy enough to cut them
yourself with a sharp rip-saw.</p>

<p><b>The Side Frames.</b> Cut the four horizontal sticks
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick and <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch
wide, by 36 inches long (<i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>), and the four upright
connecting sticks (<i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>) &frac14; inch thick, &frac12; inch
wide, and 10 inches long. Tack the upright sticks to the
horizontal ones 6 inches from the ends of the latter, as
shown in <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, using slender brads for the purpose,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and clinching the projecting ends. In fastening these sticks,
be careful to set sticks <i>B</i> at right angles to sticks <i>A</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Covering for the End Cells.</b> A light-weight muslin

the pores and make it air-tight, after it has been put on.
The light-weight brown wrapping-paper now so commonly
used is good covering material.</p>

<p>The cell bands for the kite illustrated should be 10 inches
wide and 5 feet 9 inches long. If of cloth, they should be
hemmed along each edge to prevent raveling and to make
a firm edge. If of paper, the edges should be folded over
a light framing-cord and pasted. Sew together the ends of
the cloth bands, or paste the ends of the paper bands, lapping
them so the measurement around the inside will be
exactly 5 feet 8 inches, the proper measurement around
the sticks of the finished kite.</p>

<p><b>Assembling the Kite.</b> Slip the bands over the side
frames, spread the frames to their fullest extent, and hold
them in this position by means of sticks sprung in temporarily
between upright sticks <i>B</i>. Then measure the
proper length for the diagonal braces <i>C</i> (<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>). These

<span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Detail of Diagonal Braces.</p>

<p>The notched ends of the diagonals should be <i>lashed</i> with
thread to keep them from splitting. Lashings of thread
around the frame sticks <i>A</i>, as shown in <a href="#fig_25">Figs. 25</a> and <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>,
will keep the ends of the braces from slipping away from the
uprights <i>B</i>, which is the proper position for them.
Bind the braces together at their centers with thread,
as shown in <a href="#fig_24">Figs. 24</a> and
<a href="#fig_26">26</a>.  Coat the lashings
with glue after winding them, and the thread will
hold its position better.</p>

<p>The cloth or paper bands should be fastened to each horizontal
frame stick with two tacks placed near the edges of
the bands.</p>

<p>There are several methods of</p>

<p><b>Attaching the Bridle</b>, but that shown in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>4 is
generally considered the most satisfactory. Of course, the
kite is flown other side up, with the bridle underneath.
The three-point attachment has cords fastened at the
two outer corners of one cell, and a third cord to the center
of the outer edge of the other cell; and the four-point
attachment has cords attached at the four outer corners
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the kite. The ends of the bridle should be brought
together and tied at a distance of about 3 feet from the
kite. It is a good plan to connect the ends to a fancy-work
ring.</p>

broom-handle 10 inches or so in length (<a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>). Bore
two holes through it in the positions shown, for pins to keep
the spool in its proper place. Wooden pegs can be cut for
pins. For a winding handle, pivot a spool on the right-hand

<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>. If, however, you wish a larger winding-spool,
you can use a larger can than the baking-powder can&mdash;a
tomato can or syrup can&mdash;and increase the diameter of
the wooden flanges accordingly. Instead of the spool turning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
upon the broom-handle axle, the axle turns with the
spool, so the spool must be fastened to the axle.</p>

<p>The axle supports <i>A</i> (<a href="#fig_31">Figs. 31</a> and <a href="#fig_32">32</a>) should be about
7 inches long, 4 inches wide at the wide end, and 2 inches
wide at the narrow end. Cut the holes to receive the axle
ends a trifle large so the axle will turn easily. Cut the
connecting crosspieces <i>B</i> of the right length so there will be
about &frac14; inch between the ends of the spool and supports <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>Cut the crank stick <i>C</i> as shown in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>, bore a hole
for the axle end to fit in, bore another hole in the edge for
a set-screw to hold the stick in place on the axle end, and
pivot a spool in place for a handle. If the hole in the spool
is too large for the head of the nail used for pivoting, slip
a small iron or leather washer over the nail.</p>

<p>An old belt or shawl-strap should be used for strapping
the kite-reel to your body. Fasten this to the ends of the
axle supports <i>A</i> by nailing the strips <i>D</i> to them as shown
in <a href="#fig_32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<h3>A HOME-MADE MODEL AEROPLANE</h3>


<p>Model aeronautics has become nearly as popular as kite
flying, and girls as well as boys have taken to building
these unique air toys.</p>

<p>The model aeroplane requires more work than ordinary
kite construction. It also requires more patience and
greater accuracy, because each part of the little aircraft
must be made just so, assembled just so, and "tuned-up"
just so, to produce a model which will give a good account
of itself. Of course your first model will probably not be
perfect. But if you do your work correctly and carefully
it will fly, and the experience you have acquired will make
it possible to turn out a more nearly perfect second model.</p>

<p>Many types of model aeroplanes have been devised, but those of the
simplest form of construction have made the best showing. The majority
of record-breaking models have been of one type&mdash;a triangular framework,
equipped with two planes, and a pair of propellers operated by a pair
of rubber-strand motors. A most successful model of this type is shown
in <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a>, and described and illustrated on the following pages. This
model has a distance record of 1620 feet made at the Aero Club of
Illinois' aviation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
field at Cicero, Chicago, where it flew 16 feet beyond
the fence of the 160 acre field. The model weighs but 5&frac12; ounces, has
9-inch propellers of 27 inch pitch, and is in every essential a speed
machine.</p>

<p>The first part of the model to make is the triangular</p>

<p><b>Fuselage</b>, or <i>motor base</i>. This consists of two side sticks, <i>splines</i>,
or <i>spars</i> (<i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>) of straight-grained white pine cut to the
dimensions marked upon the drawing, with their bow ends beveled off
for a distance of 1&frac14; inches, glued together, and bound with thread.
The stern ends have a spread of 8 inches, and are braced at that distance
by the <i>separator B</i> (<a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>). This separator is fastened flatwise
between sticks <i>A</i>, and its edges are reduced as shown in the small
section drawing of <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a> so they will offer less resistance to the air.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
This piece is fastened between sticks <i>A</i> with brads. Separators <i>C</i>,
<i>D</i>, and <i>E</i> are of the sizes marked in <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>, and of the proper
length to fit between side sticks A at the places indicated on the
drawing. They are cut oval-shaped, as shown in the small section
drawing in <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>.</p>

<p>Before fastening the separators in position,</p>

<p><b>The Thrust Bearings</b> for the propellers, and the <i>end plates</i> for

</div>

<p><b>The Bow Hooks</b> support the bow ends of the rubber motor, and are made
upon the ends of a piece of heavy piano-wire bent V-shaped to fit over
the ends of sticks <i>A</i> (<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>). Bind the wire to the sticks with
thread, coating the thread with glue to make it hold fast (<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Main Plane</b> has a framework built as shown in <a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>, with the
front or <i>entering-edge</i>, and the rear or <i>following</i>-<i>edge</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
made of
sticks of white pine or other light-weight wood, and the <i>ribs</i> and
<i>tips</i> on the ends made of No. 16 gauge aluminum wire. The ends of
the frame sticks are cut away on their outer edge, to receive the ends
of the wire forming the tips, and the ends of these wires, and the laps
of the wire ribs, are bound in position with thread, and the thread
then coated with glue to hold it in position.</p>

<p><b>The Elevator</b>, or front plane, has a framework made as shown in
<a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a>. Its entering-edge is a stick, and its following-edge, ribs,
and end tips, are made of No. 16 gauge aluminum wire. You will notice
by <a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a> that the center ribs cross the following-edge of the frame
and are bent up in the form of a flat loop. This loop rests against
the under side of the fuselage, and gives the elevator its proper
angle for stability (<a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>). The tips are bent up to add stability.</p>

<p>The frames of the main plane and elevator are covered with china-silk,
which may either be sewed or glued in place, and this is given a thin
coat of shellac to make it air-tight and taut. The covering must be
put on smoothly to reduce to a minimum what is known as <i>skin
resistance</i>&mdash;the resistance that the plane makes to the air while
passing through it.</p>

<p>The main plane and elevator are held to the fuselage by means of
rubber-bands slipped beneath them and over the fuselage, and unlike
the planes of the majority of models, are fastened to the under side
of the fuselage. <a href="#fig_36">Figure 36</a> shows the approximate position of the
elevator. That of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the main plane will vary under different air
conditions, sometimes being placed over the separator <i>C</i>, and at
other times closer to separator <i>B</i> than is shown in <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>. Therefore,
you must adjust your plane and elevator&mdash;this operation is known as
<i>tuning</i>&mdash;to suit the condition of the atmosphere, until you find the
positions where they will give the machine the greatest stability. A
great factor in the successful flight of a model aeroplane lies in
properly tuning the planes, both laterally and longitudinally, and of
course the planes must balance at their centers, in order to make the
machine balance properly.</p>

<p><b>The Propellers</b> are the most difficult part of the model aeroplane to
make. They must be very accurately cut, and must be of identical size
and <i>pitch</i>. The pitch of a propeller is, theoretically, the distance
forward that it advances in one complete revolution.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_43">Figure 43</a> shows one of the propellers of Harry Wells' machine, which
is 9 inches in length and has a 27-inch pitch. <a href="#fig_44">Figure 44</a> shows</p>

<p><b>How to Prepare the Propellers</b>. The pair must be opposites, that is,
one must be of right-hand pitch and the other of left-hand pitch, or,
in other words, the upper end of the right-hand pitch propeller turns
to the right, and that of the left-hand pitch propeller turns to the
left, when viewing them from the rear.</p>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;How to Prepare a 9-inch Propeller.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Step <i>A</i> consists in properly planing up a straight-grained block of
white pine 1&frac12; inches thick, 2 inches wide, and 9 inches long, with
its sides and ends straight and true, for</p>

<p><b>The Propeller Blank</b>. Draw a line around the four faces of this block
at the exact center of the length. Then on faces <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, lay off
a distance of &frac12; inch on the center-line, measuring from the edge of
face <b>B</b>, for the thickness of the propeller-hub, and draw diagonal
lines from the upper and lower left-hand corners of faces <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>
to the end of the hub center-line (Step <i>B</i>). Then cut away the
portions outside of these lines, as shown in Step <i>C</i>. Lay out the
hub upon faces <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> of the block, with a &frac12;-inch diameter,
and bore a small hole through the center to receive the propeller-shaft
(Step <i>C</i>). Draw diagonals from the corners to the center-line of the
hub (Step <i>D</i>); then cut away the wood outside of these lines (Step <i>E</i>).</p>

<p>The next step (<i>F</i>) consists in laying out the form of the propeller
blade upon all four sides and ends of the block, and Step <i>G</i> is the
final one of cutting out the propeller, scooping out its blades concave
on one side, and carving them convex on the opposite side. A very sharp
knife must be used for cutting; and the work must be done slowly and
carefully, because the least slip is likely to ruin the propeller.
The <i>entering-edge</i> of each blade is the almost straight edge, and
should be cut very thin. The ends of the blades should also be cut thin,
while the hub should be cut away as much as can safely be done without
weakening the propeller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>When you have completed cutting the propellers, place them at their
centers across the edge of a knife-blade, and if they do not balance
perfectly, locate the trouble and correct it. Finish the work with
fine emery-paper, and then shellac it. Some boys glue silk over the
ends of their propeller blades, for a distance of &frac12; inch or so, to
reinforce them and make them less likely to split.</p>

<p><b>The Propeller-shafts</b> are made of heavy piano-wire, bent into a hook
at one end (<a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>) to receive the rubber strands of the motor, and
cut of the right length to extend through the hole in the bearing,
through a glass bead, through the propeller, and then to bend over
the side of the hub (<a href="#fig_37">Figs. 37</a> and <a href="#fig_38">38</a>). By bending over the end of the
shaft against the hub, it is held securely in place.</p>

<p><b>The Motors</b> consist of twelve strands of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>-inch flat rubber, each,
and as these are 1 yard in length, exactly 24 yards of rubber are
required. The rubber is not connected direct to the hooks on the bow
and propeller-shafts, as the wire would quickly cut through the strands.
Instead, small rings are bent out of wire, with pieces of small
rubber-tubing slipped over the wire, and the ends of the rubber strands
are looped through these rings and bound in place with thread (<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).
The wire rings are then slipped on and off the hooks quickly. As light
and heat cause rubber to deteriorate, you must remove the motors from
the machine after use, pack away in a covered box, and keep in a cool
place, in order to get the longest life possible out of the rubber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been found that rubber motors can be wound much farther by
lubricating them with glycerine. It is only necessary to put a few
drops of the glycerine upon a clean cloth, and rub it over the outside
strands; then wind the motors, and it will work over the surface of the
inner strands until all parts are covered.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;How the Motors are Connected to Winder for Winding.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course the rubber motors must be twisted an equal number of turns,
in order to make the propellers work the same, and this is usually done
with an ingenious winder made from an egg-beater, which winds both
motors simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Home-made Motor-winder</b> shown in <a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a> is made from a Dover
egg-beater (<a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a>). To convert the egg-beater into a winder, it is
necessary to cut off the loop ends and the center pivot wires on which
the loops turn. Then bend the cut-off ends of the loops into hooks, and
punch them to fit over the pivot wire ends, as before (<a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>). The
ends of the pivot wires must be riveted to keep the hooks in position.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_47">Figure 47</a> shows</p>

<p><b>How the Egg-beater Winds the Motors</b>. While an assistant supports
the model by the propeller end, you remove the motor rings from the
hooks on the bow of the fuselage, and slip them on to the hooks of
the egg-beater. Then you turn the crank of the winder, counting the
turns as you do so, and when you have wound the motors as far as you
wish, slip off the motor rings, and slip them back on to the bow hooks
of the model aeroplane. Motors of models like that shown in this
chapter are wound one-thousand turns or more for each flight.</p>

<p><b>Wind the Motors Slowly</b>, especially after the first row of knots
begin, as it puts the rubber to the least amount of strain by doing
this. Quick winding not only strains the rubber but makes the knots
form in bunches, and uneven winding, of course, produces an uneven
unwinding.</p>

<p>The propellers must be held after the motors have been wound, to keep
them in check. <a href="#fig_34">Figure 34</a> shows</p>

<p><b>The Position to Take for Launching a Model</b> from the hand. The machine
should not be thrown forward, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the movement would cause too great a
disturbance of the air, resulting in the machine losing its stability,
and probably upsetting. The best method is to give the model a slight
push that will start it off at a speed a trifle under that produced by
its propellers.</p>

then smooth up the edges with a plane and sandpaper. The stern should
be sawed off on a bevel as shown in <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>.</p>

bow end on a line with the bow of the bottom block, and the stern end on
the same slant as the bevel cut on the stern of the bottom block. With
one piece in position, nail on the second side and trim off its ends.
If you have any difficulty in making a neat joint between the bow
ends of sides <i>B</i>, take a piece of tin from a can, bend it around the
bow, and tack it in place as shown in <a href="#fig_48">Fig. 48</a>. The stern piece (<i>C</i>,

<p><b>To Complete the Boat</b>, go over the work carefully, trim off all
projecting edges, drive nail heads beneath the surfaces, putty nail
holes and cracks, and give the wood two coats of paint of whatever color
you want to have the motor-boat.</p>

<p><b>The Propeller</b> (<i>E</i>, <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>) is cut from the side of a tin can. Cut
a piece 3 inches long and &frac34; inch wide, round its ends, and with the
point of a nail pierce a hole through it each side of the center of
the length of the piece (<a href="#fig_55">Fig. 55</a>). To finish the propeller, it is only
necessary to take hold of the two ends and twist the piece into the
shape shown in <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Propeller-shaft</b> requires a short piece of wire with one end bent
into a hook (<i>F</i>, <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>). Stick the straight end of this shaft through
one hole in the propeller, and the hooked end through the other hole,
then twist the hooked end over on to the main part of the shaft, as
shown in <a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57</a>. Make a tight twist so the propeller will be held
perfectly rigid on the shaft.</p>

<p><b>The Bearing Plate</b> <i>G</i> (<a href="#fig_54">Figs. 54</a> and <a href="#fig_58">58</a>) supports the propeller. Cut
it out of a piece of tin 1&frac12; inches wide by 3 inches long, bend it
in half crosswise to give it stiffness, and then bend it lengthwise
to the angle shown so it will fit over the slanted stern of the boat.
Punch two holes through the upper end for nailing the plate to the
stern, and a hole at the lower end for the propeller-shaft to run
through.</p>

<p><b>For a Thrust Bearing</b>, slip a couple of beads over the propeller-shaft,
between the propeller and bearing plate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<i>G</i>. Probably you can find
glass beads in your mother's button bag.</p>

<p>After slipping the beads on to the shaft, and sticking the shaft through
the hole in bearing plate <i>G</i>, bend the end of the shaft into a hook;
then screw a small screw-hook into the bottom of the hull, at the bow
end (<i>I</i>, <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>), and you will be ready for</p>

<p><b>The Rubber-band Motor.</b> Rubber-bands about 1&frac12; inches in length are
best for the purpose. Loop these together end to end (<a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>) to form
a strand that will reach from hook <i>I</i> to the hook on the
propeller-shaft; then form three more strands of this same length, and
slip the end loops of all four strands over the hooks.</p>

<p><b>To Wind the Motor</b>, give the propeller about one hundred turns with
your finger; then, keep hold of the propeller until you launch the boat.</p>

<p>There are many ways of elaborating upon the design and construction
of this toy motor-boat, but, having given the necessary instructions
for building a simple model, I am going to leave further development
for you to work out. Here is an opportunity for you to use your
ingenuity. Devise an adjustable rudder, add a keel, finish off the
cockpit with a coaming, install a headlight made from a pocket
flashlight&mdash;in fact, see just how complete a motor-boat model you can

<h3>HOME-MADE TOY WATER-MOTORS</h3>


<p>You can own a water-motor like the one shown in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>, because its
construction requires nothing but easily obtained materials.</p>

<p><b>The Case</b> of this water-motor is made of an empty varnish
can&mdash;preferably one of gallon capacity. Nothing better could be desired.
The tin can makes a lightweight compact case; the spout in the top is in
just the right place and of the right size to receive the water power
from a faucet; and as the water connections can be made tight there is
no possibility of water splashing on to the floor&mdash;a big argument in
your favor when seeking permission to use the motor in the bath-tub,
wash-basin, or kitchen sink.</p>

</div>

<p>You can get an empty varnish can from any painter, or at a paint store.
The first step in converting the can into the motor case consists in
removing the bottom. You will find this soldered in place, in all
probability, and it can be removed quickly by holding the can over
the flame of a gas burner until the solder melts, when a few taps
upon the edges will cause the piece of tin to drop off.</p>

<p><b>The Water-motor Wheel</b> is shown in the cross-sections of the
water-motor (<a href="#fig_63">Figs. 63</a> and <a href="#fig_64">64</a>), and <a href="#fig_65">Figs. 65</a> to <a href="#fig_67">67</a> show its details.
The diameter of the wheel should be about &frac12; inch less than the
inside width of the can. In
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the model from which the drawings were
made, this measurement is 5&frac12; inches. Cut the two side pieces of
the wheel out of a piece of cigar-box wood, and bore a &frac14;-inch
hole through the center of each for the wheel axle. Fasten a spool
to the center of one side piece for a pulley-wheel (<a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a>).</p>

<p><b>Prepare Eight Paddles</b> 1&frac34; inches wide and 2&frac12; inches long,
out of cigar-box wood. Locate the positions for the ends of the
paddles, upon the side pieces, by drawing a horizontal line, a
vertical line, and two diagonal lines at angles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of 45 degrees,
through their centers. This will simplify the matter of spacing
the paddles equidistant from one another (<a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a>). Use brads for
fastening the side pieces to the paddle ends. Those removed from
the cigar boxes will do.</p>

<p><b>The Wheel Shaft</b> should be a trifle shorter than the inside width
of the can, and enough smaller than the &frac14;-inch hole in the wheel
side pieces so the wheel will turn freely. Locate the centers for
the axle upon the two sides of the can, in the proper position so
there will be the same margin above and at the ends of the wheel.
Drive a nail through each side of the can into the axle end.</p>

<span class="smcap">Figs. 66 and 67.</span>&mdash;Details of Water-motor Wheel.</p>
</div>

<p><b>An Outlet</b> for the water after it has passed over the wheel paddles
must be provided, and the best way is to fasten a strip to two opposite
sides of the can so as to raise the bottom about an inch, as shown in
<a href="#fig_62">Figs. 62</a>, <a href="#fig_63">63</a>, and <a href="#fig_64">64</a>.</p>

<p><b>For a Pulley-belt</b> use a piece of heavy cord. Cut a slot through the
front of the can for the belt to run through,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and make this slot large
enough so the cord will not rub against the sides (<a href="#fig_63">Fig. 63</a>).</p>

<p><b>Pulley-wheels</b> for attaining different speeds can be made of spools
of various sizes. A bicycle wheel with the tire removed, mounted in
a frame, is excellent for a large wheel.</p>

  Connection between Faucet and Water-motor.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Connecting up the Water-motor.</b>  If you operate the water-motor in
the kitchen sink, you can either build a platform as shown in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>,
to bring the spout of the varnish-can case up to the level of the
faucet, or you can set the water-motor in the sink and lead a piece of
rubber tubing from the spout to the faucet, as shown in <a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68</a>. If
you use the latter arrangement, slip the lower end of the rubber tubing
over a short piece of glass, brass, or tin tubing, and stick the short
tubing through a hole in a cork large enough to fit the spout of the
varnish-can case (<a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>). If you raise the water-motor high enough so
the faucet will set down into the spout, you can cut a large enough
hole for the faucet, through a cork, and then fit the cork in the
spout as shown in <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a>.</p>

<p><b>Another Water-motor.</b> The little water-motor in <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a> will furnish
sufficient power to operate simple mechanical toys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Water-motor Wheel.</b> Procure two baking-powder can covers for the
ends of the water-motor wheel (<i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>), a cigar-box out of which
to make the wheel paddles, and a stick &frac14; inch square and 5 inches
long for the wheel axle (<i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>).</p>

<p>Cut eight paddles from the cigar-box wood 1 inch wide and 5 inches
long. Take a pair of these strips and fasten them to one can cover,
in line with each other, and close against the sides of the cover
(<i>C</i>, <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73</a>). Fasten
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
with tacks or brads driven through the cover
into the ends of the strips. Take another pair of strips and fasten
them to the same cover, in a similar manner, at right angles to pair
<i>C</i> (<i>D</i>, <a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>). Then tack the pairs of strips <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> to the
cover halfway between pairs <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>. With the paddles in
position, locate the exact center of the end of the can cover, and
drive a nail through at this point into the end of axle <i>B</i>. Slip
the free ends of the paddles into the other can cover, and carefully
drive tacks or brads through the cover into them. Drive a nail
through the center of the cover into the end of axle <i>B</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Wheel Supports.</b> <a href="#fig_74">Figure 74</a> shows the supports for the wheel.
Cut the end pieces <i>G</i> 4 inches wide and 6 inches high, and the
cross strips <i>H</i> 1&frac34; inches wide and 5&frac12; inches long. Nail
pieces <i>G</i> to <i>H</i>, as shown, allowing the lower ends of <i>G</i> to
extend &frac12; inch below
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
strips <i>H</i>, and leaving a space of &frac12; inch
between strips <i>H</i>. The axle holes in pieces <i>G</i> (<a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>) should be
located in the center of the width of these pieces, and halfway
between their tops and strips <i>H</i>. Bore the holes with a gimlet,
or make them by driving a large nail through the pieces, and then
withdrawing it.</p>

<p><b>To Mount the Wheel</b> upon the supports, withdraw the nails driven
into the ends of axle <i>B</i>, slip the wheel between uprights <i>G</i>, and
drive the nails through the holes in <i>G</i> back into the holes in the
axle ends (<a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Pulley Wheel.</b> One can cover should be converted into a pulley
by winding several turns of string around it, near each edge, leaving
a groove between the string. Coat the string with glue to make it stick
fast to the cover.</p>

<p><b>The Water-motor Case.</b> <a href="#fig_70">Figure 70</a> shows how the water-motor case is
constructed by fastening boards <i>N</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>J</i>, <i>K</i>, <i>L</i>, and <i>M</i> to
the wheel supports <i>G</i>. There must be a slot through <i>I</i> and another
through <i>J</i>, for the string
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
belt to pass through, and a hole through
<i>K</i> for the intake of water from a faucet. These can be cut out of the
edges of the boards, as shown, before they are nailed in place. Leave
an opening between boards <i>N</i> and <i>M</i>, and the bottom of ends <i>G</i>,
for an outlet for waste water.</p>

<h3>A HOME-MADE TOY RAILWAY</h3>

<p>It is often thought that a toy railway is beyond a boy's ingenuity to
construct, whereas, in reality, it is one of the simplest toys he can
make. This applies to the tracks, stations, and cars of every
description, all of which can be made with a few strips of wood, some
spools, nails, cardboard, and a bottle of glue, for materials. If you
have passed the age of caring for such toys as this, you will, no doubt,
enjoy the making of one for your younger brother, or for one of your
boy relatives.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_76">Figure 76</a> shows a railway set up and in running order. As shown in the
illustration,</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;Support for Trolley-line.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Trolley-line</b>, or overhead cable, runs
around the wheels of two supports, one at
either end of the track. Prepare four
pieces of wood the shape and size of that
shown in <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a> for the uprights of these
supports, and make two wheels three
inches in diameter. The wheels may be marked out with
a home-made compass&mdash;a pencil tied to the end of
a piece of string, if you haven't a compass. When
the wheels have been cut out, place them in your bench-vise,
one at a time, and with a file make a groove
around the edge as shown at <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>. Bore a three-eighths-inch
hole through each upright at <i>F</i>, <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a>,
and another through the center of each wheel. Now fasten
two of the uprights six inches apart upon a block of wood, as shown at
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>. Whittle
a shaft to fit loosely in the holes of the uprights, and,
after slipping it into them, fasten one of the wheels
upon one end and a small spool upon the other (see
<i>C</i> and <i>D</i> in <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>). A weight of some sort should be
fastened to the base, as shown at <i>E</i>. The uprights for
the other support should be similarly mounted upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
another block of wood. Fasten the remaining wheel to an
axle run through the holes in the uprights, and, as it is
unnecessary to have a spool upon the other end of the
axle, cut it off short and drive a nail through it to prevent
it from slipping through the holes. Having thus prepared
the supports, place them as far apart as you wish to
extend the railway, and run a cord around the two wheels
and tie it. Then set the supports a little farther apart,
if necessary, to tighten the cord. Run another cord from
spool <i>D</i> to</p>

end of each stick, and drive a short finishing nail in the
opposite end (see <a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a>). Cut the cardboard strips the
length of the sticks, and tack them to the sticks as shown
in the illustration. If inch and one-half spools are used
for the car wheels, the inside gauge of the tracks should
be an inch and three-quarters. By lapping the cardboard
strips over the ends of the sticks, and the sticks
over the ends of the cardboard strips, and placing the nail
dowels in the ends of the sticks as in the drawing, a strong
track is formed when the pieces are fitted together. This
may be extended to any desired length by adding more
sections to it.</p>

a little beyond the hole, as shown in <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>.
Then bore four holes in the edges of
the truck-bed with a gimlet at <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>,

the pegs before placing the spools in the frame. A quarter-inch
hole should be bored in the top of the truck-bed at <i>G</i>
and <i>H</i> (<a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>) in which to fasten the two uprights <i>I</i> and

each and run a piece of heavy wire from one to the other,
bending it as shown in <a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>. Fasten <i>K</i> between <i>I</i>
and <i>J</i>, as shown. Place a small brass ring upon the wire
before you fasten it in place. A small hook should be
screwed into one end of the truck and a screw-eye into
the other end, for couplings, should you wish to hitch two
or more cars together.</p>

the upper part of the sides should be two and three-quarters
inches. Cut the two inner ends of the car the shape of
<a href="#fig_88">Fig. 88</a>, using a compass with a radius of two and one-half
inches with which to describe the curve at the top. Draw
in the panels and sash lines as you did those upon the
side pieces, being careful to get them on the same level,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and cut out the door and window openings. Fasten
these end pieces between the sides with glue, and also
tack them to the uprights of the car (<i>I</i> and <i>J</i>, <a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>),
which will come just inside of them. The roof is made
in two sections (<i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>). For <i>B</i> cut a piece of
cardboard twelve and one-quarter by three and three-quarter
inches (<a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a>), draw the curved end with a compass,
using the radius shown on the drawing, and slit the
corners as indicated by the dotted lines. When this
piece has thus been prepared, remove the wire from the
top of the truck (see <a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>). Bend the cardboard over
the sides and ends of the car, and lap corners <i>D</i> and <i>E</i>
over <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, and <i>H</i> and <i>I</i> over <i>J</i> and <i>K</i>, tacking them
with thread to hold them in place. To fasten this part
of the roof to the top of the car, cut a number of small
strips of linen, and glue them to the under side of the roof
and to the inside face of the sides and ends of the car
(see <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>). The upper portion of the roof <i>C</i> should be
made out of a piece of cardboard bent into the shape of
<a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>, and cut at the ends so the upper portion of <i>C</i>
projects a little beyond its sides. Draw the ventilation
lights upon the sides of <i>C</i> as shown on the drawings, and
then fasten the piece upon the top of <i>B</i> with strips of
linen in the same manner as you fastened <i>B</i> in place.
<i>C</i> should now have the same curve to its top as <i>B</i>. Cut
and glue a piece of cardboard in each end of <i>C</i> to complete
the roof. The shape of this piece is shown in <a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a>.
The outer ends of the car should be made as shown in
<a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92</a>, and tacked around the ends of the wooden truck
platform, and also fastened to the under side of the roof
with strips of linen.</p>

<p>The window openings may be cut
in each end, but it will make a stronger car if they are
simply drawn upon it. Cut four cardboard steps similar
to <a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a> and tack them to the sides of the front and rear
platforms. When the car has been put together, replace
the wire in the tops of uprights <i>I</i> and <i>J</i> (<a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>), running
the ends through the roof (see <a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>). Paint the
sides and ends of the car yellow with brown trimmings,
and paint the roof a light gray. Water colors can be used
for the purpose. Letter the name of your car-line upon
the sides and the number of the car upon each end and
side. The route should be lettered upon strips of cardboard
with pins run through them as shown in <a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>,
these strips to stick in the roof of the car (see <a href="#fig_84">Figs. 84</a>
and <a href="#fig_85">85</a>).</p>

<p>Having seen how the car is made, you will find it a
simple matter to make designs for</p>

<p><b>Other Cars</b>, using the same scheme for the trucks, and
altering the patterns for the sides, ends, and roof, to suit
the design.</p>

<p>Nothing has, as yet, been said about the</p>

<p><b>Operation of the Railway</b>, and though <a href="#fig_76">Fig. 76</a> probably
shows sufficiently clear how it is run, a few words may
be helpful. The car or cars are placed between the wooden
tracks, and the trolley (or cord attached to the ring on
top of the car) is tied to the trolley-line as in the illustration.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Upon starting your engine, water-motor, or
whatever motive-power you have, the car will run from
one end of the track to the other. When it has reached the
support of the trolley-line, it will stop long enough for
the cord trolley to pass around the wooden wheel, and
then run in the opposite direction until the other support
is reached. It will thus be seen that the trolley hangs to
the upper part of the cable, or trolley-line, in running
one way, and to the lower part on the return run. In
changing the direction of the run, the ring to which the
trolley is attached slides to the other end of the car.</p>

<p><b>A Station</b> such as is illustrated in <a href="#fig_95">Fig. 95</a> is made out
of cardboard and mounted upon a seven-eighths-inch
board large enough to form a railway platform. After
cutting out the side and end pieces, with door and window
openings placed as shown in the illustration, fasten
them together with strips of linen glued in the corners.
Make the roof low and extend it over the platform upon
each side and over the gable-ends, as shown in the illustration.

<h3>HOME-MADE TOY ELEVATORS</h3>


<p>The elevator shown in <a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a> is a unique mechanical toy
well worth one's making. Release the little car at the top
floor, and it will descend to the ground floor, and then
return to the starting point, without you having to touch
it a second time. A magical elevator? Perhaps so. A
little mechanical device performs the trick.</p>

<p>The same plan may be followed for installing the doll-house
elevator in Chapter XIII, but the more stories there
are the more fun there is in operating the elevator. This is
why I have adapted the scheme to</p>

<p><b>A Toy Office Building.</b> Six stories are shown in <a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a>,
but you can make a modern sky-scraper with as many
stories as you like. A packing-case 3 feet 6 inches long,
stood on end, was used for the model. Another box or two
can be added to the top for additional stories. Besides the
box, or boxes, get enough box boards for floors and partitions.</p>

<p><b>Make the Floors</b> in two pieces (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_98">Fig. 98</a>), so the
opening for the elevator shaft can be cut out of the end of
one piece in the manner shown. This opening should be
about 5 inches square. Mark out and cut the boards for all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of the floors at one time, and be careful to get the shaft
opening the same in each floor. Cut the notch <i>C</i> in board
<i>A</i> about 1 inch square.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 372px;">
<a name="fig_96" id="fig_96"></a>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>&mdash;A Toy Office Building with Elevator.</p>
</div>

<p>Fasten the floor boards in place with
nails driven through the sides of the box.</p>

<p><b>The Partitions</b>, a pattern for which is
shown in <a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a>, can be made quicker by
omitting the doorway, but this is easy to cut
by sawing along the sides and then splitting
out the piece between the saw cuts.</p>

<p><b>The Elevator Car</b> should be built up of cigar-box wood, as
shown in <a href="#fig_101">Figs. 101</a> and
<a href="#fig_102">102</a>. The front portion
(<i>D</i>) should be about 3 inches wide, 2&frac12; inches
deep, and 4 inches high, and the rear portion
(<i>E</i>) should be of the same width, 2 inches deep, and 2&frac12;
inches high. Fasten these upon the base piece <i>F</i> as shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Elevator Guides.</b> Bore the holes <i>G</i> through the
top and bottom of the car, close to the sides, for guide
wires <i>H</i> to run through (<a href="#fig_101">Figs. 101</a> and <a href="#fig_102">102</a>). These holes
may be bored with a screw-eye if you haven't a gimlet or
drill. Bell-wire, or almost any wire that you have on
hand, will do for the guides. Fasten two screw-eyes into
the under side of the top of the shaft, the same distance
apart as holes <i>G</i>, and in the proper position so they will
come exactly over them (<i>I</i>, <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>). Use the car for
determining these measurements. Then bore two holes
through the bottom of the shaft directly below the screw-eyes
(<i>J</i>, <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>). Attach the wire to one screw-eye, run
it down through holes <i>G</i> in the car, through one of the holes
<i>J</i>, then across to and up through the other hole <i>J</i>, up
through the other set of holes <i>G</i> in the car, and attach to
the second screw-eye <i>I</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Cables.</b> The elevator is lifted by means of cord <i>L</i>
(<a href="#fig_97">Figs. 97</a> and <a href="#fig_101">101</a>). Fasten this cord to a tack driven into
the top of the car, then run it up and over spool <i>M</i> (<a href="#fig_97">Figs. 97</a>
and <a href="#fig_101">101</a>), over spool <i>N</i> (<a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>), and tie to weight <i>K</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Counter-balance.</b> A bottle, filled with sand to
make it weigh more than twice as much as the car, should
be used for this. Screw a small screw-eye into the cork
to tie the cord to.</p>

<p>The counter-balance runs up and down in</p>

<p><b>The Smoke-stack</b>, which is fastened to the back of the
building (<a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>). Make the stack of cardboard mailing-tubes,
joining them end to end with bands of paper pasted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
around them. Fasten the stack to the back of the
building with wire straps, and brace the top as
shown in <a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a>, but
leave it unattached until you have adjusted</p>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>&mdash;Section through Elevator Shaft.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Overhead Pulleys</b>, or <i>sheaves</i>. These are
spools. You will see by looking at <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a> that
spool <i>M</i> turns on the axle <i>O</i>, and the ends of this
axle are cut to fit snugly in screw-eyes <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>Fasten pulley spool <i>N</i> in the smoke-stack by means
of a wooden axle pushed through holes pierced in
the side of the stack, as is shown in the small drawing
above, <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>. Bore
a hole through the back of the building for the
cable cord <i>L</i> to run
through (<i>P</i>, <a href="#fig_97">Figs. 97</a> and
<a href="#fig_100">100</a>), and cut another
through the smoke-stack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><b>How the Car Operates.</b> When the weight and cord
have been adjusted and the smoke-stack erected, the elevator
will run from the ground floor up to the roof of its
own accord, because the counter-balance is much heavier
than the car. To make it descend it is necessary to add
weight to the car, to make it enough heavier than the
counter-balance so it will drop of its own accord. This is
done with</p>

<p><b>Ballast</b> consisting of a bottle of sand or salt of twice
the combined weight of counter-balance <i>K</i> and the car.
After filling the bottle, cork it up, and screw a screw-eye
into the cork. Then screw the eye of a
2-inch hook-and-eye into the roof of the
building, directly over
the center of box <i>E</i> of the elevator (<i>R</i>, <a href="#fig_97">Figs. 97</a> and <a href="#fig_101">101</a>),
and attach one end of a rubber-band to the hook and tack
the other end to the top of the elevator-shaft (<a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101</a>).</p>

<p>With the hook and rubber-band properly adjusted, this
is what happens when the car ascends to the top of the
shaft. The bottom of the rear portion of the car strikes
bottle <i>Q</i>, lifts it enough to release the end of the hook (<i>R</i>),
and the rubber-band springs the hook out of the way
(<a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>). The bottle remains upon the rear portion of
the car, and its weight carries the car to the bottom of the
shaft.</p>

<p><b>A Simple Control</b> for stopping the car at the
different floor levels. Stick <i>S</i> may be a piece of
broom-handle, curtain-pole, or flagstaff. Bore a
hole through the bottom of the shaft, directly below
holes <i>C</i> in the floors (<i>T</i>, <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>), and slip
the stick through hole <i>T</i> and into slots <i>C</i>. Then
locate on one side of stick <i>S</i> points just below
the under face of each floor, and upon the opposite
side locate points just above where the back edge
of the elevator will come when the car is raised to
each floor level (<a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>). Remove the stick, and
drill or bore a small hole at each point marked; then replace it, nail a small
block (<i>U</i>, <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>) across the
top end to hold it in place, and drive a nail, with its head filed
off, into each of the holes.</p>

<p>When stick <i>S</i> is turned to the
position shown in <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>, while the car is going down,
the first nail below the car will project beneath it and
bring it to a stop; and if the stick is turned in the
opposite direction while the elevator is going up, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
first nail above the car will project over the back edge

<p>If there is a kitchen porch to your house, construct</p>

<p><b>The Outdoor Elevator</b> shown in <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a> to run from the
ground up to that porch. If you live in an upper story of
an apartment building, your elevator can be made to run
to a greater height, which, of course, will make more fun.</p>

<p>It will save considerable work to use the porch, because
for one thing you will not have to build an upper platform
to stand upon to reach the elevator car when it runs to the top, and for
another thing the supports for the guides and cable can
be fastened directly to one of the porch posts.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_105">Figure 105</a> shows a large detail of</p>

<p><b>The Guide Supports.</b> Cross strips <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> should be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
18 or 20 inches long, about 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick.
At a distance of about 1 inch from one end of strips <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> screw a screw-eye into one edge, and 8 inches from those
eyes screw a second screw-eye (<i>D</i>, <a href="#fig_105">Fig. 105</a>). Screw-eyes
with &frac12; inch eyes are large enough. A dozen will cost about
5 cents at the hardward store. The elevator guides are
fastened to these.</p>

<p>Besides the screw-eyes there must be two clothes-line
pulleys for the cable to run over. These cost 5 cents
apiece. Screw one pulley into the edge of strip <i>B</i>, halfway
between the two screw-eyes <i>D</i> (<i>E</i>, <a href="#fig_105">Fig. 105</a>), the other
into an edge of strip <i>C</i> at the same distance from the end
that you have placed the pulley in strip <i>B</i> (<i>F</i>, <a href="#fig_105">Fig. 105</a>).</p>

<p>Nail strip <i>A</i> to the porch post as close to the ground as
you can get it, strip <i>B</i> to the same face of the same post,
about 18 inches above the porch railing, and strip <i>C</i> to the
opposite face of the post at the same height as strip <i>B</i>.
Nail these strips securely in place.</p>

<p>If you cannot find a starch-box or other small box out
of which to make</p>

<p><b>The Car</b>, go to a grocery store. You will be sure to find
just what you want there. It is not likely that the grocer
will charge you anything for a small box like this. If
you have placed screw-eyes <i>D</i> 8 inches apart, as directed,
the width of the box should be a trifle less than this measurement,
but if the box you pick up is wider the screw-eyes
can be spaced as much farther apart as is necessary to
accommodate it.</p>

<p><b>The Counter-balance</b> is a large can filled
with earth, sand, or small stones. Its weight must be equal to about three times
that of the empty car. Fasten the lifting cable through holes punched in opposite
sides of the can (<a href="#fig_107">Fig. 107</a>).</p>

<p>Use a strong wrapping-twine for</p>

<p><b>The Lifting Cable.</b> After tying this to
the counter-balance, run it over pulley <i>F</i>,
then over pulley <i>E</i>, and tie to screw-eye <i>H</i> in the top of
the car. The cable must be of the right length so when
the counter-balance has dropped to the ground the car
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
will come just above the porch railing, as shown in

<p><b>The Lowering Cable</b> to the screw-eye screwed into the
under side of the car.</p>

<p>As long as the weight of the car and its load remains
less than half of that of the counter-balance, the counter-balance
will drop and by so doing lift the car. The cable
attached to the bottom must be pulled to lower the car.</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE MECHANICAL TOYS</h3>


<p>Those of you boys who have examined the little mechanical
toys sold upon the street corners just before Christmas
probably have been surprised to find how simply they are
made, and perhaps it has never occurred to you that you
might make toys equally as good for presents for your
younger brothers, sisters, or cousins. Most of the smaller
mechanical toys are not only easy to make, but they require
materials which cost little and can usually be picked
up at home. Sometimes it takes considerable thinking
and planning to discover just the things which can be
adapted to the various parts of toys; but that is where
part of the fun of toy making comes in.</p>

<p><b>A Buzz-saw Whirligig</b> is an interesting toy (<a href="#fig_108">Fig. 108</a>).
Lay out a disk about 5 inches in diameter upon a piece of
cardboard, locate the position for the spool-end on the
center of each face, and make four rings outside of this.
Divide the circumference of the disk into sixteen equal
parts, and lay off the teeth as shown. (<a href="#fig_111">Fig. 111</a>.) The
spool-ends used for centers should have two holes drilled
through them for the twisting cord to slip through, and
should be fastened to the disk with glue or brads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>A cotton string is best for</p>

</div>

<p><b>Operating the Whirligig.</b> After slipping it through the
holes in the spool-ends, tie the ends together. To work
the toy, slip the first finger of each hand through the loop
of each end, and whirl the disk in one direction until the
string is twisted from both ends as far as the center.
Then pull firmly on the ends of the string, and the disk
will whirl in the opposite direction until the string is untwisted
and twisted up again in the opposite direction. As
the strings twist, slacken your hold upon the ends, and when
it has wound up tight pull again to make it whirl in the
opposite direction. The disk should whirl very steadily
when working right, and the knack of making the string
twist so the disk will do so is attained with a little
practice.</p>

<p><b>The Clog-dancer</b> (<a href="#fig_109">Fig. 109</a>) is an easily made loose-jointed
doll. His dancing-stage is a shingle or piece of
stiff cardboard held on the edge of a chair beneath your
knee. He is held by means of the string attached to his
head, so that his feet rest lightly upon the stage, and
he is made to jig by tapping the outer end of the
stage with the free hand.</p>

<p>The more grotesque the dancer's appearance is, the more amusing his dancing
will be, so the cruder you make him the better. <a href="#fig_112">Figure 112</a> shows the
working details for his construction. The center part of a thread-spool
forms the <i>head</i>, and a spool-end and the rounded end of a broom-handle
form the <i>hat</i>. These three pieces are nailed together.
The <i>body</i> is a piece of a broom-handle, and a spool-end nailed to it
forms the <i>shoulders</i>. Drive
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a nail into the end of the body, tie a string to this, and

through a hole in the hat; tie the string to a fancy-work ring.</p>

<p>The <i>arms</i> and <i>legs</i> are made of sticks whittled
to the lengths marked in <a href="#fig_112">Fig. 112</a>, and about
&frac14; inch in diameter, and are jointed by driving
tacks into their ends and connecting these with heavy linen thread.
<a href="#fig_112">Figure 112</a> shows how
the feet and hands are cut, and how tacks are driven into them for the
thread connections. Paint the clog-dancer's body, arms, and legs
white, his head, hands, and feet black, and mark his eyes, nose,
and mouth upon his face in white.</p>

<p><b>A Toy Jumping-Jack</b> is always amusing, and <a href="#fig_110">Fig. 110</a>
shows a simply constructed home-made model. You will
see by <a href="#fig_113">Fig. 113</a> how the figure is made. The peaked _hat_
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
is half a spool tapered down from the end to the center;
and the <i>head</i> is the center from a darning-cotton spool,
shaped down at one end for a <i>neck</i>, and with eyes, nose, and
mouth cut in on one side. <a href="#fig_113">Figure 113</a> shows the diagrams
for the front and back of the <i>body</i>, the <i>arms</i>, and the <i>legs</i>.
These are cut out of cigar-box wood. Cut the neck stick
A long enough to run through the head and hat, with a
square block on the end to fit between the body pieces.
The blocks <i>B</i> should be of the same thickness as block <i>A</i>.
Bore the pivotal holes through the arms and legs in the
positions shown, using a small gimlet or red-hot nail with
which to do the boring, and tie a piece of heavy linen thread
through each as shown. The arms and legs are pivoted on
brads driven through the front of the body into the back.</p>

<p>When the body has been fastened together, bring the
ends of the threads together, and tie to a small ring; also
knot the threads close to the body to keep them together.
In painting Jack, you might provide him with a red coat,
blue trousers and a blue hat, white stockings, and black
shoes.</p>

<p><b>A Cricket-rattle</b> is about the liveliest form of rattle
ever devised (<a href="#fig_114">Fig. 114</a>). After constructing one for your
sister or brother, you probably will decide to make one for
yourself. For this rattle, first prepare a <i>notched spool</i> (<i>A</i>,
<a href="#fig_116">Fig. 116</a>). The notches in this need not be cut as perfectly
as shown, but the notches in one end of the spool must be
exactly opposite those in the other end. Whittle the <i>handle
B</i> to the shape and size shown, cut the strips <i>C</i> out of cigar
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
box wood, and prepare the block <i>D</i> as shown. The groove
in the edge of <i>D</i> is cut of just the right width to receive the
end of the wooden strip <i>E</i>. The length of <i>E</i> is best determined
after nailing the ends of strips <i>C</i> to <i>D</i>, and slipping
the handle through the holes in strips <i>C</i> and spool <i>A</i>. It
should extend from the groove in <i>D</i> into the notches in <i>A</i>.
Make it as wide as the spool is high. Paint the rattle red
or blue.</p>

<p><b>The Turtle Toy</b> which crawls along the floor when you
alternately pull and slacken a thread that runs through
its shell, has always been one of the most popular of mechanical
toys, and you will be surprised to find how easily our
home-made model shown in <a href="#fig_115">Fig. 115</a> is put together. The
<i>shell</i> is a small tin mold such as is used for molding jellies.
One about 4 inches long costs 10 cents. A mold having the
form of a bunch of grapes is a pretty good form for the
turtle shell, as you will see by the illustrations.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 118.</span>&mdash;The Spool Wheels and the Rubber-bands which Propel them</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>head</i>, the <i>tail</i>, and the four <i>feet</i> are cut out of tin from
a can, and bent into the forms shown in <a href="#fig_117">Fig. 117</a>. Then
slits are cut through the narrow rim of the mold by piercing
the tin with the point of a nail at the proper places for
attaching them, as shown in the small detail drawing, and
the tab ends are pushed through the slits, bent over, and
clinched with a pair of pincers.</p>

<p>A thread spool 1&frac14; inches long forms the <i>wheels</i> on which
the turtle runs, and two rubber-bands 1&frac12; inches long
propel it. Cut a piece of a lead pencil a trifle longer then
the spool, split it into halves, remove the lead, and insert
the rubber bands in the groove; then slip the piece of pencil
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
into the hole in the spool (<a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a>). The rubber-band
ends must project an equal distance beyond the spool-ends.
Before fastening the spool to the tin mold shell, tie the end
of a piece of heavy linen thread to its center, and then
wind about twenty turns about it. Pierce a hole through
each side of the mold a trifle in front of the center, and
after slipping pieces of string through the ends of the rubber-bands
(<a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a>), tie them through the holes pierced through
the sides of the mold. Pierce a hole through the shell,
directly over the center of the spool, slip the free end of
the thread wound on the spool through this hole, and
tie it to a fancy-work ring (<a href="#fig_117">Fig. 117</a>).</p>

<p><b>To Make the Turtle Crawl</b>, place it upon the floor, pull
on the ring, and as the thread unwinds from the spool the
rubber-bands will twist; then slacken the thread, and the
turtle will crawl along the floor. As the rubber-bands
untwist, the thread will wind up on the spool again. Continue
pulling and slackening the thread alternately, and the
turtle will continue to crawl.</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE TOPS</h3>


<p>There are many styles of tops, probably more than you
ever dreamed of, and it will surprise you to hear that the
owners of some of the most curious forms are bearded men
who take as much delight as any girl or boy in spinning
them. A few years ago on Murray Island, which is way
down among the South Sea Islands, top spinning took
such a strong hold upon the attention of the natives that
they neglected their work, and families often were without
food, boys and girls having to go to school hungry.
Matters became so serious, in fact, as a result of this fad
for top spinning, that, finally, the head chieftain was compelled
to restrict it to certain days. There are many experts
among these South Sea Islanders. The men sing songs
while their tops spin, cheer them on, and take the greatest
precautions to shelter them from wind. An eye witness
of a contest reported that the winning top spun 27 minutes,
which you must admit is a pretty long time.</p>

<p>Whip-tops and peg-tops of several varieties can be purchased
at the corner candy store, but the kinds I am
going to show you how to make cannot be bought anywhere.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Clock Wheel Tops.</b> A splendid spinner can be made of
the little balance-wheel of a broken clock (<a href="#fig_119">Fig. 119</a>).
This little wheel is so accurately made that it will spin
very steadily from a minute and one-half to two minutes.
As the ends of this wheel's axle are pointed, the top will
stand in one spot as long as it spins.</p>

<p>The toothed wheel shown in <a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a>, or any of the other
forms of wheels from a clockwork will make good spinners,
yet, unless you file their pivot ends to points, they will not
spin in one spot but will glide and hop over the table in
spirals. The friction thus produced decreases the length
of time that they will spin, but makes them none the less
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
interesting as tops. Great fun may be had spinning these
wheel tops around the balance-wheel top, while the latter
is spinning. <a href="#fig_129">Figure 129</a> shows how to hold a clock wheel
between the thumb and first finger, for spinning. Start it
with a snapping movement of the fingers.</p>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 125.</span>&mdash;A Shoe-polish Can Top.</p>
</div>

<p><b>A Rug-Tack Top.</b> A rug tack or large upholstering tack
is another good spinner. While the clockwork wheels are
spun by twirling them by means of the upper end of the
pivots, the tack top is spun by holding the spinning point
between the thumb and first finger, as shown in <a href="#fig_122">Fig. 122</a>,
then giving it a quick twirl and dropping it upon a table.
The tack top is an eccentric spinner. First it hops about
in a very lively fashion; then, when you think it is about
ready to topple over, it regains its balance and for some
seconds spins quite as steadily as the clockwork balance-wheel
top. The tack top can be spun upon its head as
well as upon its point.</p>

<p><b>A Spool Top.</b> The top in <a href="#fig_123">Fig. 123</a> is made from a half of
a spool and a short piece of lead-pencil. Saw a spool into
halves, and then taper one half from its beveled end to the
center. Sharpen the piece of pencil to a point, and push it
through the spool until its point projects just a trifle.
Spin the spool top in the same way as the clock wheel tops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Spinning Top Race-track.</b> By drawing a track upon
a piece of cardboard, as shown in <a href="#fig_129">Fig. 129</a>, with an opening
on the inside, great fun may be had by starting any one
of the small tops just described, with the exception of the
balance-wheel top, in the center of the
space inside of the track, and tilting
the cardboard so as to cause the top to spin through the
opening on to the track, and around the track. There is
a trick in keeping the top from running off the track
that can be acquired only with practice.</p>

<p><b>A Shoe-polish Can
Top</b> (<a href="#fig_125">Fig. 125</a>). This
is a sure-enough good looking top, and it
spins as well as it looks. It is made of a pencil, a cone-shaped
piece cut from a spool, similar to the top shown
in <a href="#fig_123">Fig. 123</a>, and an empty shoe-polish can.</p>

<span class="smcap">Figs. 126-128.</span>&mdash;Details of Shoe-polish Can Top.</p>
</div>

<p>The dotted line in <a href="#fig_126">Fig. 126</a> indicates how the end of the
pencil sticks through a hole in the shoe-polish can, then
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
through the cone-shaped piece of spool. The hole through
the can must be located in the exact center, so the top
will balance properly. To find the center, place the box
bottom down upon a piece of paper, and with a pencil
draw a line around it. Cut the paper along the center, and
you will have a piece the shape and size of the can bottom.
Fold the piece in half, then in half again the other way
(<a href="#fig_127">Fig. 127</a>), open it up, and the intersection
of the two folds, indicated by
dotted lines in <a href="#fig_128">Fig. 128</a>, will be the exact
center. With the center located, place the piece of
paper first upon the bottom, then upon
the top of the can, and punch a hole through the center
of it and the can, with the point of a large nail. Increase
the size of the hole enough to admit the pencil.</p>

<p>Spin this top in the manner shown in <a href="#fig_125">Fig. 125</a>. Hold
the upper part of the pencil between your hands, with the
palms together, and slide your hands back and forth, first
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
slowly, then rapidly. Release it so as to cause it to drop
squarely upon its point upon a level wooden surface.
The steadiness of this top's spinning will depend entirely upon the accuracy
with which you cut the center
hole for the pencil.</p>

<p><b>A Spiral Top.</b> The top in <a href="#fig_130">Fig. 130</a> presents a curious appearance
while spinning, the spiral design upon it seeming to change its
form as the top revolves.</p>

<p>The only difference between the construction of this
top and the shoe-polish can top is in the substitution of
the spiral disk for the polish can. A pencil and cone-shaped
piece of spool are required as in the case of the other top.</p>

<p>The spiral design for the disk, shown
in <a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131</a>, is large enough so you can
make a tracing of it on a piece of transparent paper,
and then trace it off upon a piece of cardboard.  Fill
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
in alternate rings with black ink or water-color, in the
way shown, then cut out the disk, pierce a hole through
its exact center to fit over the pencil end, and glue the
under side to the top of the cone-shaped piece of spool.
Spin this top in the same way as the shoe-polish can top is
spun (<a href="#fig_125">Fig. 125</a>).</p>

<p><b>A Merry-go-round Top</b> (<a href="#fig_132">Fig. 132</a>) is a new idea easily
carried out. You will require a cardboard disk 12 inches
in diameter, three spools, a pencil, and some light-weight
cardboard.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_133">Fig. 133</a> shows the details for this top. If you haven't
a compass, use a large-sized dinner plate with which to
draw the circumference of the disk (<i>A</i>). Then cut a
conical-shaped piece of spool (<i>B</i>), stick the lead-pencil
through it for a spinning point (<i>C</i>), punch a hole through the
disk to fit over the pencil, and tack the disk to <i>B</i>. Cut
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
off a third of the length of a ribbon spool for <i>E</i>, and
fasten another spool (<i>D</i>) to the top of the pencil. Spool
<i>D</i> should be glued fast to the pencil, and the spool-end
<i>E</i> should turn loosely upon it. Coat the lower part
of the pencil with glue so it will stick fast in <i>B</i>.</p>

<p><b>How the Top Spins.</b> When you have made this much of the top, spin it
to see how it works. Wrap the spinning cord&mdash;a strong
lightweight wrapping-twine&mdash;about spool <i>D</i>, in the same
manner that you wind the cord on any top; then, holding
spool end <i>E</i> with the left hand (<a href="#fig_132">Fig. 132</a>), pull steadily
upon the cord with the right hand until all is unwound, and gently
drop the top upon its spinning point. To get the best results, the
cardboard used for the disk platform must be very straight. If it
warps, flatten it by pressing it under a pile of books.</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE CLOCKWORK TOYS</h3>


<p>The toys shown opposite <a href="#Page_90">page 90</a> are a few of the many
mechanical toys which can be operated by clockwork,
and they are easy to make, too, requiring no more mechanical
ability than is possessed by the average boy old enough
to handle the simplest of tools.</p>

<p>Generally it is easy to find an old clock somewhere
about the house, and a clock which has been discarded
simply because it has become worthless as a timekeeper
is perfectly good for operating these toys, provided the
<i>mainspring</i> is in working order. It is not necessary to
have a set of works for each toy, for they are so quickly
fastened in place that but a minute is required to transfer
the works from one toy to another.</p>

<p>Before commencing work upon the toys, get together</p>

<p><b>The Other Necessary Materials.</b> These will consist of
cigar boxes, cardboard, cotton or silk spools, glue, brads,
and a few pieces from the woodpile, with one or two additional
articles which are mentioned later on. Brads
<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch and 1 inch in length should be purchased for fastening
the framework of the toys together, and the cigar
boxes should be about 8 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in size. Remove the paper from the boxes as described on
<a href="#Page_175">page 175</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;How the Clockwork Motor is Fastened to the Cigar-box Cover.<br />
<span style="font-size:.7em">(This Box has been cut down to the Proper Length for the Ferris Wheel.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>To Prepare the Clockwork</b> for use, remove it from its
case, detach the hands and face, and pry off the small
wheel pivoted directly under the hands; this wheel is
shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>. Remove also the <i>balance-wheel
B</i> (<a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>) and the <i>lever C</i> pivoted next to it, to increase
the speed of the remaining wheels.</p>

<p>Fasten the clockwork motor for</p>

<p><b>The Merry-go-round</b> shown in <a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135</a> to the cover of
a cigar box, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_136">Figs. 136</a> and <a href="#fig_139">139</a>, boring
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
holes through the cover with a gimlet for the <i>pivot</i> ends
on the back of the works to set into. Remove the lower
flange from a spool (<i>D</i>, <a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>) and fasten the spool
on to the central pivot of the clockwork in the position
formerly occupied by wheel <i>A</i>. The hole in the spool
will be too large for the pivot and must be filled up with
sealing-wax. To do this, hold a piece of sealing-wax
above the spool and melt it with a lighted match, allowing
it to drip into the hole until the latter is about half
full, then press the wax down with the end of a match
until it is compact, smooth it off on the bottom of the
spool, and make a dent in it with a pencil to indicate the
exact center of the hole. Heat the end of the pivot with
a lighted match, and press it into the dent in the wax,
being careful in doing so to get the spool straight upon
the pivot. Cut a hole through the bottom of the cigar
box belonging to the cover to which you have attached
the works, for spool <i>D</i> to project through (<a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>).</p>

<p><b>To Make the Standard</b> for the merry-go-round, cut four
strips of wood 8 inches long, and fasten one to each corner
of the cigar box, turning the bottom side of the box up;
then cut a piece of &frac12;-inch board 10 inches square, locate its
center <i>F</i> by drawing diagonal lines from corner to corner
as shown in <a href="#fig_140">Fig. 140</a>, bore a 1-inch hole through it at this
point for spool <i>D</i> (<a href="#fig_136">Fig. 136</a>), and then nail the box to the
center of the board as shown in <a href="#fig_140">Fig. 140</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Tent</b> should be laid out upon heavy white paper
as shown in <a href="#fig_141">Fig. 141</a>. After describing a circle with a
radius of 9 inches, describe another circle within it with
a radius of 7&frac12; inches, this inner circle (shown by dotted
lines in the diagram) being drawn for a guide in fastening
the tent upon its tent-poles. </p>

<p><b>The Horses.</b> A full-size pattern for these is shown in
<a href="#fig_143">Fig. 143</a>. Take a piece of <i>tracing-paper</i> or any thin transparent
paper, and place it over the pattern and make an
exact copy; then rub a soft lead-pencil over the other side

marking them off first with a pencil to be sure of getting them
spaced at equal distances. Point the ends of the shafts and glue
them into the holes in the hub, then connect this spool to spool

<p><b>For the Platform</b> shown directly under the horses and
sleighs in <a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135</a>, cut a piece of cardboard 11 inches in
diameter; if you choose to make the Ferris wheel before
the merry-go-round, you may use the center pieces removed
in cutting out the rims, as noted in <a href="#fig_153">Fig. 153</a>. Punch
a hole through the center of this disk large enough for the
peg connecting spools <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> to slip through. This
platform rests upon the top of spool <i>D</i> and revolves with it.</p>

<p><b>To Operate the Merry-go-round.</b> The key by which
the mainspring is wound up is shown screwed in place on
the under side of the cigar-box cover in <a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>. While
winding the mainspring, it will be necessary to have some
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
means of checking it so it will not unwind at the same
time, and the best scheme for a check is to bore a small
gimlet hole through the cover of the cigar box and stick
a match through this and run it between the spokes of one
of the clock wheels so as to prevent it from turning. Then
when you have wound up the spring and are ready to start
the merry-go-round, all you have to do is to pull out the
match.</p>

<p>The model of this toy which the author has before him
runs for five minutes with one winding, and any boy can
make one which will run as well if he follows the directions
given and uses a reasonable amount of carefulness in the
work.</p>

<p><b>Other Animals</b> than horses may be used if you wish to
follow the arrangement of some of the latest merry-go-rounds,
and pictures of these may be found among the
colored cut-outs sold in the stationery stores, or if you
can draw well, you may copy them from books and magazines.
Great fun may be had by changing the positions
of the boy riders, making them ride backward part of the
time and sometimes two and three boys on a horse.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have heard of the famous Ferris wheel,
and a good many of you have ridden in the smaller wheels
patterned after it, at the amusement parks, so you will be
interested in making</p>

<p><b>A Miniature Ferris Wheel</b> like the one shown in <a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Standard</b> for supporting the wheel (<a href="#fig_149">Fig. 149</a>)
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
consists of two triangular supports, one with a spool hub
fastened to its top for the axle of the wheel to run through
and the other with the cigar box inclosing the clockwork
fastened to it. <a href="#fig_150">Figures 150</a>, <a href="#fig_151">151</a>, and <a href="#fig_152">152</a> show the construction
of these supports. Cut strips <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> 12 inches
long and <i>R</i> 10 inches long, and trim off the upper ends of
<i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> so when they are nailed together the lower ends
will be 8 inches apart; nail strip <i>R</i> to the lower ends of
<i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> (<a href="#fig_150">Fig. 150</a>). To
fasten the spool hub to its support, smear one side of
a piece of tape with glue and wind it several times
around the spool (<a href="#fig_151">Fig. 151</a>),
then set the spool on top of the support and press the
ends of the tape against the
sides of strips <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> (<a href="#fig_152">Fig. 152</a>).</p>

was fastened (<a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>), but the length of the
box is cut down as much as the clockwork will allow to
make the box as square and compact as possible.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to have the axle bearings exactly
on a line in order to have the wheel run smoothly, so, in
fastening the cigar box to its support, be sure that the center

<p><b>To Make the Wheel</b>, first lay out the rims upon a piece
of heavy cardboard, using the radii shown in <a href="#fig_153">Fig. 153</a>
for describing the circles, then lay the sheet of cardboard
upon a board and</p>

<p><b>Cut out the Rims</b> with a sharp knife, being careful
not to run off of the pencil line. The</p>

<p><b>Hubs</b> of the wheel are spools with six holes bored
in them for the spokes to fit in (<a href="#fig_156">Fig. 156</a>). Cut six</p>

<p><b>Spokes</b> 5&frac34; inches long
by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick for each
hub, and cut a slot in one
end of each for the cardboard rims to fit in (<a href="#fig_154">Figs. 154</a>
and <a href="#fig_157">157</a>). Use a saw rather than a knife in making the
slots, for it will make a kerf of just the right width to
receive the cardboard and will not be so apt to split the
ends of the slender spokes. Whittle the hub ends of the
spokes to fit the holes in the spool hubs (<a href="#fig_154">Figs. 154</a> and
<a href="#fig_157">157</a>). In</p>

<p><b>Putting together the Spokes, Hubs, and Rims</b> of the
wheel, first stick three spokes in a hub and slip a rim into
the slots in their ends, then stick the remaining spokes
into the hub, one at a time, and spread the rim enough so
it can be slipped into their
slots (<a href="#fig_155">Fig. 155</a>).</p>

<p>When the hubs, rims, and spokes have been assembled,
lay them aside and get some heavy wrapping-paper
or thin cardboard out of which</p>

<p><b>To Make the Cars.</b> The pattern for the cars is shown
in <a href="#fig_158">Fig. 158</a>, and on it you will find all the dimensions
necessary for laying it out to the proper size. It will be
understood that the unfigured portions of the drawing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
are the same as those with dimensions marked upon them.
The dotted lines at the door and window openings indicate
where the cutting is to be done, while all other
dotted lines indicate where the cardboard is to be <i>scored</i>
and folded.</p>

<p>Use a ruler in making the drawing of the car to get the
lines straight, and when you have finished it go over it
carefully and compare it with the illustration to be sure
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
it is correct, after which make a careful tracing of it, turn
it over and transfer the drawing five times upon cardboard.
These and your original drawing will give you the required
number of cars. Cut out the openings with a sharp knife
and then do the rest of the cutting with a pair of scissors;
punch a &frac14;-inch hole in each end of each car with a lead-pencil
(<a href="#fig_158">Fig. 158</a>), being careful to get the holes exactly
opposite. In folding and gluing the cars, slip the flaps
inside and bend the roofs so they will follow the curve of
the ends (<a href="#fig_159">Fig. 159</a>).</p>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>&mdash;A Completed Car for the Ferris Wheel.</p>
</div>

<p>When the cars have been completed, cut six sticks
5 inches long, whittle them down until they are about 3/16
inch in diameter, and sandpaper them until they are perfectly
round and smooth. These sticks connect the rims
of the wheel and form</p>

<p><b>The Axles</b> from which the cars are hung (<a href="#fig_159">Fig. 159</a>).
Great care must be used in fastening them between the
rims, for they are easily split, and the best way to do is
to start a hole first in the ends of each axle with an awl
or by driving a brad part way in and then withdrawing
it; then drive a brad through each spoke of one rim into
an axle (<a href="#fig_157">Fig. 157</a>); slip the other ends of the axles through
the holes in the ends of the cars (<a href="#fig_159">Fig. 159</a>), and nail the
spokes of the other rim to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p><b>To Mount the Wheel</b> upon its standard, whittle an axle
8&frac12; inches long to fit the hubs, then hold the wheel between
the two uprights, with the hubs on a line with the spool
bearings and run the axle through the holes (<a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a>).</p>

<p><b>Build Steps</b> at each end of the platform out of heavy
writing-paper or light cardboard. Fold the paper or cardboard
back and forth, making pleats about &frac14; inch wide for
the steps, and after gluing it in place cut out the <i>balustrades</i>
and glue them to the edges of the steps. Make the
top step low enough so there will be about &frac14;-inch clearance
between it and the bottom of the cars (<a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a>).</p>

<p>After you have made a final inspection to see that
everything has been put together properly, your toy will
be ready for operation, and I am sure that when you set
the clockwork machinery in motion, and the little wheel
begins to revolve slowly with each little car balancing
upon its axle, you will agree that you have constructed
a very interesting toy.</p>

<p><b>The "Flying Airships"</b> is a riding device consisting of
a number of cars suspended by steel cables from large
arms pivoted to the top of a tower. When the machinery
is started, the arms begin to revolve slowly, and the
motion produced causes the cars to swing out away from
the center. As the speed of the arms increases, the cars
swing out farther and farther, until when the highest
speed has been reached the cables by which the cars are
suspended have taken an oblique position and raised the
cars some distance above the ground; then the speed of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the engine is gradually diminished, and the cars finally
regain their former position. This piece of apparatus is
also known as an <i>aerostat</i>.</p>

<p>You will find the miniature flying airships (<a href="#fig_138">Fig. 138</a>)
easy to construct after making a merry-go-round or Ferris
wheel, as many of its details are identical with those of the
other toys.</p>

<p><b>The Standard</b> for the toy is made similar to the one for
the merry-go-round (<a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135</a>), except that the top board
is omitted and a circular piece of cardboard of the size
of the disks removed in cutting out the rims of the Ferris
wheel is substituted in its place. Cut a hole through the
exact center of the piece large enough so it will fit over
spool <i>D</i> (<a href="#fig_136">Fig. 136</a>).</p>

<p><b>Cut a Mast</b> about 14 inches long and of the diameter
of the hole in the spool and stick it into spool <i>D</i>; then
3 inches below the top of the mast fasten a spool with
four horizontal arms 6 inches long glued into holes bored
in it. Fasten a crosspiece 4&frac12; inches long to the end of
each arm with brads, and from these suspend</p>

<p><b>Cars</b> made similar to those of the Ferris wheel, with
cords. Set a small flag in a hole bored in the top of the
mast and then run cords from the top of the mast out to
the ends of the arm pieces.</p>

<p>With this toy the cars cannot be swung out obliquely
as on the large flying airships except by</p>

<p><b>Increasing the Speed of the Clockwork.</b> This can be
accomplished by removing one or two of the wheels of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the clockwork, but it is not advisable to take out more
than one wheel in addition to those removed for the merry-go-round
(<a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>) because the mainspring would require
rewinding too often to make the toy enjoyable.</p>

<p><b>An Electric Motor</b> can be belted to these toys as a substitute
for the clockwork, if you own one and prefer to try
it out.</p>

<p>The clockwork toys just described were invented by the
author for his book "Handicraft for Handy Boys," and
were the first designs, he believes, devised for home-made
mechanical toys of this nature. No doubt you have noticed
that manufacturers of the so-called "construction sets"&mdash;steel
and wood strips supplied with bolts and screws for
assembling&mdash;have used these very same forms of models to
show what can be made with their outfits. But your
Ferris wheel, merry-go-round, and aerostat, built as described
in this chapter, with materials picked up at home,
will be the equal of any that can be built, and you will have
the satisfaction of knowing that you haven't required an
expensive "construction set" for making them.</p>

<p>All sorts of toy vehicles can be operated by clockwork.
<a href="#fig_160">Figure 160</a> shows</p>

<p><b>An Automobile</b>, and <a href="#fig_161">Fig. 161</a> shows how the clockwork
motor is mounted upon the chassis and belted to the driving
wheel. The same scheme that was used for the cars of
the toy railway described in Chapter VI will be followed
in making</p>

way, and makes a light, easy-running vehicle.</p>

</div>

<p>The bed will be cut of a different pattern, however, as will be
seen in <a href="#fig_162">Fig. 162</a>. Lay out the piece to the dimensions
shown upon this drawing, and then cut it out, making a
mortise in each end for the wheels to fit in. The spool
wheels should be mounted in the same manner as those
of the railway cars, for which see <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>, Chapter VI, and
the directions upon <a href="#Page_51">page 51</a>. One end of spool <i>A</i> should
be pivoted with a longer finishing nail than those used for
the other pivots, so that when driven in place about half
an inch will project beyond the frame. A small silk spool
should be fastened upon this for a belt-wheel (see <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_162">Fig. 162</a>).
The hole in one of these spools is about three-sixteenths
of an inch in diameter, so, in order to make it fit
tightly upon the nail, it is necessary to fill in around the nail
with sealing-wax. To do this, turn the wooden frame
upon its edge and place the spool over the nail, being
careful to get the nail in the exact center of the hole.
Then hold a stick of sealing-wax over the spool, and with
a lighted match melt the end and allow it to drip into the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
hole. When the hole has been partially filled, allow the
wax to harden a little, and then press it down around the
nail with the end of a match, being careful not to throw
the spool out of center by doing so. The hole should then
be filled to the top.</p>

<p>We are now ready to prepare the clockwork for mounting
upon the wooden frame. The works shown in <a href="#fig_161">Fig. 161</a>
are from an alarm clock, but if you have a striking clock,
or one with works a little different from those shown in the
illustration, it does not make a bit of difference in the
scheme for attaching the works. The three parts shown
in the foreground of <a href="#fig_161">Fig. 161</a> must first be removed from
the works. These will be recognized readily in any clock,
as they are pivoted close together, and regulate the speed
of the other wheels. When they have been removed, the
mainspring will unwind rapidly. The frame of the works
shown in the illustration is held together with nuts, so
that in removing the wheels it was necessary to unscrew
two of them, spring the frame open enough to let the
wheels drop out, and then replace the nuts again in their
former positions. If the frame of your clockwork is
riveted together, the wheels will have to be broken out.
A small silk spool, such as <i>B</i> (<a href="#fig_162">Fig. 162</a>), should be fastened
upon the small pivot which originally operated the clock's
hands, for a belt-wheel. Lay the works upon a table with
the face-side down, and, after centering the hole of the spool
upon the pivot, fasten it in place with sealing-wax in the
same manner as you attached spool <i>B</i> (<a href="#fig_161">Fig. 161</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>The works should now be attached to the wooden
frame. Place them with the striker uppermost, near the
edge of the frame, so that the small belt-wheels are in
line with one another. Then bore a number of gimlet
holes in the wooden frame and run copper wire through
them, passing it around the posts of the clock-frame and
twisting its ends until the works are firmly fastened in
place.</p>

<p>A rubber band about an eighth of an inch wide and long
enough to reach from one belt-wheel to the other should
be procured for</p>

<p><b>The Belt.</b> This should stretch just enough to cling
upon the spools, as more than that would cause too much
friction.</p>

<p>Before going any further with the construction of the
automobile</p>

<p><b>Test the Machine</b>, to be sure that it is in perfect running
order. Wind up the mainspring, pressing a finger against
one of the wheels to hold it in check until you are ready to
start the machine. When properly made, the clockwork
automobile should run a distance of from twenty to twenty-five
feet upon a wooden floor, while about three-quarters
of that distance should be covered upon a floor with a fairly
smooth carpet.</p>

<p><b>The Cardboard Sides</b> and other details of the automobile
should now be made. The patterns for these have
been so shown in <a href="#fig_163">Figs. 163</a> to <a href="#fig_170">170</a> that they can easily be
laid out to the proper shape and size by means of the process
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of enlarging by squares described on <a href="#Page_175">page 175</a>, Chapter
XVII. White cardboard should be used upon which to
draw these pieces, and the thinner it is
the easier you will find it to work with.</p>

<p>First prepare the two sides, cutting them out by the pattern of <a href="#fig_163">Fig. 163</a>.
Then glue the bottom edge of each side to the edge of the wooden frame, cutting
holes in the left side for the belt-wheels and projecting posts to run through (see
<a href="#fig_160">Fig. 160</a> and <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>E</i>,
<a href="#fig_172">Fig. 172</a>). The top to the front of the car
should now be cut as shown in <a href="#fig_173">Fig. 173</a>,
the distance between the sides being measured to get the piece of proper
dimensions. Bend the edges as in <a href="#fig_173">Fig. 173</a>, and glue them
to the inner surfaces of the side pieces as shown by the
dotted lines in <a href="#fig_172">Fig. 172</a>. In the same way cut and glue

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

<p><b>Wheels</b> as shown in <a href="#fig_164">Fig. 164</a>, using a compass with which
to describe the circles, and cut them out with a sharp
knife. You can cut out between the spokes, if you wish,

placing their centers about as located at <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>, <a href="#fig_172">Fig. 172</a>. Four</p>

<p><b>Mud-Guards</b> should be cut like <a href="#fig_165">Fig. 165</a>, with flaps made

of the wheels, and, after applying glue to the flaps,
press them against the cardboard side, holding your
fingers upon the flaps until
the glue has dried (see <a href="#fig_160">Fig. 160</a>). The guards should be

(<a href="#fig_160">Fig. 160</a>) shows where different colors are needed. The
lamps, top, ends, and sides of the front portion of the car
should be painted the color of brass, and the rest of the
sides, with the exception of a strip along the bottom and
the edge of the arms, should be painted vermilion. Paint
the inside of the car and the edges of the seat-arms tan
color, to represent leather upholstering. With black
paint, or ink, stripe off the door and trimmings upon the
sides and top of the machine, as shown in <a href="#fig_160">Figs. 160</a>, <a href="#fig_172">172</a>,
and <a href="#fig_173">173</a>. Blacken the brake and steering-wheel and the
spokes and rims of the wheels. Along the bottom of each
side glue a strip of cardboard for the running-boards.</p>

<p>When you have tired of your touring-car, you can easily
convert it into</p>

<p><b>An Automobile Delivery Wagon</b>, such as illustrated in
<a href="#fig_175">Fig. 175</a>. To make this you will require the same frame
as that used for the touring-car, with the clockworks and
belt-wheels attached in the same manner. If you have
made the touring-car, remove the cardboard sides from its
wooden frame, separating the cardboard from the wood
carefully so you can put the machine together again when
you wish. If you haven't made this automobile, you will
find the details for the construction of the frame in <a href="#fig_161">Figs. 161</a>
and <a href="#fig_162">162</a>, and the manner of performing the work
described on pages <a href="#Page_104">104</a> to <a href="#Page_107">107</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Cardboard Sides</b> are much easier to prepare than
those for the touring-car, as they are straight and require
but little cutting. The outline for these is shown in <a href="#fig_175">Fig. 175</a>,
surrounding the drawing of the completed wagon.
Lay out one side upon a piece of cardboard, using the
dimensions given upon the drawing, and then place it upon
a board and cut it out with your knife. Using this as a
pattern, place it upon another piece of cardboard and run
a pencil around its edges, thus marking out the second
side. In cutting out the latter piece, run your knife a little
inside of the line in order to allow for the increase in size
caused by marking it out with the first cardboard side.
Having prepared the two sides, draw panels upon them in
some such form as shown in the illustration, separating
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
them with three lines. Draw a small window, with its
top slightly arched, near the front edge of each side, and
cut an opening for it (see illustration).</p>

<p>Glue the sides to the edges of the truck in the same
manner as those of the touring-car were done, piercing
holes for the posts of the clockwork to fit in, and openings
for the belt-wheels to project through, in the left side.
Cut a piece of cardboard for the back of the wagon, fit it
between the sides, and fasten it in place by gluing a number
of linen strips to it and the sides upon the inner or unexposed
surfaces. Then cut a piece of cardboard for the
roof, making it about two inches longer than the sides, to
give it the proper projection over the front of the wagon.
Fasten this piece in position in the same manner as you
fastened the back of the wagon.</p>

<p>Make the floor and footboard for the wagon out of a
piece of cardboard bent as shown in <a href="#fig_175">Fig. 175</a>, and fasten
it across the top edges of the projecting portions of the sides
with linen strips. Cut a strip for a seat, and fit it between
the sides an inch and one-half above the floor.</p>

<p><b>The Wheels</b> of an automobile wagon contain fourteen
spokes, but as you have the pattern for the touring-car
wheels of twelve spokes, you can just as well use it in
making the wagon wheels. They should be mounted upon
the sides of the wagon, a trifle above the bottoms of the
spool wheels, as shown in the illustration, so they will not
touch the carpet when the machine is operated.</p>

<p><b>All Other Portions</b> of the wagon should be made of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
same patterns given for the touring-car, viz. the chauffeur
(<a href="#fig_169">Figs. 169</a> and <a href="#fig_170">170</a>), the steering-wheel (<a href="#fig_167">Figs. 167</a> and <a href="#fig_174">174</a>),
the brake (<a href="#fig_160">Fig. 160</a>), and the lamps (<a href="#fig_166">Fig. 166</a>). As the
legs of the chauffeur will show, it will be necessary to cut a
pair out of cardboard (the drawing shows the shape clearly
enough to work by) and fasten them to his body. Fasten
the chauffeur upon the seat and glue his left hand to the
steering-wheel, placing the latter in front of him, as shown
in the drawing. Stick the lower end of the cardboard
upright of the steering-wheel upon a pin run through the
wagon floor from the under side. Glue the upper end of
the brake to the chauffeur's hand and the lower end to the
side of the wagon.</p>

<p><b>Paint the Wagon</b> with water colors, making the sides,
end, and roof olive green, the steering-wheel, brake, and
spokes of wheels black, and the lamps yellow or the color
of brass. In painting the sides show the battery compartments
upon them below what would properly be the bottom
of the wagon (see illustration). Leave the cardboard white
below this box, as it represents no portion of the machine,
but is necessarily brought down so far to conceal the
wooden frame. It will give the machine a more finished
appearance if, after painting, you go over it with black
paint and a fine brush and stripe the panels upon the sides,
following the lines which you drew upon them with a pencil.
Letter the word "Delivery" upon the center panel of
each side, and the firm name in the small panel between the
lamp and window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>By attaching a set of clockworks in the same manner as
described for the automobiles, you can make</p>

<p><b>A Clockwork Railway</b>, constructing the cars similar
to the street car shown in <a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>, Chapter VI, and using
the schemes in the same chapter for the tracks and depots.</p>

<p>Each car should be provided with a clockwork motor,
because a single clockwork is not strong enough to pull
more than one car. Let me know how you succeed in
building a clockwork railway.</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE ELECTRICAL TOYS</h3>


<p>An entire volume might be filled with plans for electrical
toys and yet not exhaust the innumerable forms that are
within the ability of a boy to construct. There is room
in this chapter for only a few, and I have selected simple
ideas, those that can be carried out by a boy having no
knowledge of working with electricity, with materials that
can be obtained at an expenditure of little or nothing.
Thus every boy will be able to make these electrical toys.</p>

<p><b>The Electro-magnet Derrick</b> shown in <a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a> will
hoist nails and other small pieces of hardware from the
floor to a table top, and as the <i>boom</i>, or arm, can be swung
from side to side, and raised and lowered, loads can be
moved from place to place in the same way as with large
derricks. The toy derrick may be used for loading and
unloading toy wagons, carts, and trains of cars, provided,
of course, you use iron or steel of some sort for your loads.
It is easy enough to get nails, brads, tacks, and odd pieces
of hardware for the purpose. The model from which <a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>
was made has lifted a bunch of two hundred and
eighty-four brads <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch long. By using smaller brads,
or tacks, a much larger number could be lifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The first part of the toy to construct is</p>

<p><b>The Electro-magnet.</b> The difference between an electro-magnet
and the toy variety of horse-shoe magnet with
which every boy is familiar, is that the electro-magnet
retains its magnetism only so long as an electric current
is passing around it, while the steel magnet retains its
influence permanently, after being magnetized, unless it
happens to be demagnetized by subjection to heat, or in
some other way.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_177">Figures 177</a> to <a href="#fig_179">179</a> show the details for making a simple
home-made electro-magnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>An electro-magnet consists of a center <i>core</i> of soft iron,
wrapped with a coil of insulated wire. When an electric
current passes over a wire, a <i>magnetic field</i> is formed around
the wire; and when several turns of insulated wire are
wrapped about a soft iron core, the magnetic fields of all
the turns of the coil, or <i>helix</i>, combine, forming a very
strong magnetic field which strongly magnetizes the iron
core. As I have said before, this magnet loses its magnetic
influence the instant the current ceases to pass
through the surrounding coil of wire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig_177" id="fig_177"></a>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Figs. 177-179.</span>&mdash;The Electro-magnet.</p>
</div>

<p>You will need a machine-bolt or carriage-bolt 2&frac12; or 3
inches long, and &frac14; inch in diameter, for the core of the
magnet, some insulated electric-bell wire for the coil, and
a piece of heavy cardboard. Cut three washers of a trifle
larger diameter than the bolt-head, out of the piece of
cardboard (<a href="#fig_178">Fig. 178</a>), and slip these over the bolt as shown
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in <a href="#fig_179">Fig. 179</a>&mdash;one at the bolt-head end, the other two at
the nut end; then screw the nut on to the end of the bolt.</p>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 180.</span>&mdash;How the Electro-magnet is Connected up.</p>
</div>

<p>Before starting to wind the insulated wire upon the
bolt, pierce two holes through the inner cardboard washer
of the two at the nut end. Then stick the end of the wire
through one of these holes, and pull a length of 4 or 5 inches
of the wire out between the two washers. Starting at
this end of the bolt, then, wind the wire around the
bolt, keeping the turns even and each turn pressed
close against the preceding turn. When the washer
at the head end of the bolt has been reached, wind
back to the starting point; then wind back to the
washer at the head a second time, and again back
to the starting point; and so on until six or eight layers
of wire have been wound in place. An even number of
layers will bring the free end of the wire back to the
double-washer end. Slip this end through the second
hole in the inner washer, and bring it out between the
two washers, as you did the first end. Then screw the
bolt-nut tight against the washers, to hold the wire
ends in place (<a href="#fig_177">Fig. 177</a>). The outer cardboard washer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
will prevent the nut from chafing the insulation on the
wire ends.</p>

<p>Now connect the ends of the coil to the binding-posts of
a battery cell, and you will be surprised to find what a
strong magnet the head of the bolt core has become.</p>

<p>One end of the magnet coil should be connected to a
dry-cell, and the other to a switch; and another wire
should connect the switch with the dry-cell (<a href="#fig_180">Fig. 180</a>).</p>

<p><b>A Home-made Switch</b> that is easily made is shown in
<a href="#fig_181">Fig. 181</a>. Cut strips <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> (<a href="#fig_182">Fig. 182</a>) from a tomato
can. Tack the turned up ends of <i>A</i> to a wooden knob (<i>D</i>).
This forms the switch lever. Strips <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, folded in
half, and punched near the ends, form the binding-post
plates.</p>

</div>

<p>Instead of using a separate base, the switch can be
mounted as shown in <a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>, upon the base of</p>

<p><b>The Derrick</b>. Cut the base about 8 inches wide and 10 inches long (<i>A</i>,
<a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>). The <i>mast</i> (<i>B</i>)
is a piece of broom-handle or curtain-pole 16 inches long, and fits loosely in a
hole bored in the base. <a href="#fig_183">Figure 183</a> shows a detail
of the mast. The <i>pulley</i> upon its upper end (<i>C</i>) is
made of two spool-ends nailed together (<a href="#fig_184">Fig. 184</a>),
and it turns upon the axle <i>D</i>, which slips through
holes in the <i>plates E</i> nailed to the end of the mast.
The <i>lever F</i> sticks in a hole in the mast, close to the platform.
This is used to swing the <i>boom</i> from side to side.
Screw-eye <i>G</i> is placed several inches above <i>F</i> to serve the
purpose of a pulley to guide the hoisting cables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#fig_185">Figure 185</a> shows a detail of the <i>boom</i>. Cut the side
sticks <i>H</i> 18 inches long, and fasten between them the
<i>separators I</i>, which should be just long enough to allow
clearance for the <i>spool pulley J</i>. The pulley is mounted
on the axle <i>K</i>. Screw the lower ends of the boom to the
mast, at a point 2&frac12; inches above the base.</p>

<p><b>The Windlass</b> for raising the derrick boom, and for
hoisting the loads, is shown in
detail in <a href="#fig_186">Fig. 186</a>. Bore a hole
through upright <i>L</i> for the axle <i>M</i> to stick through, and cut
axle <i>M</i> enough smaller than the spool drums <i>N</i> so they will turn
easily. Fasten a crank and handle to one end of each spool, and drive
a brad through each end of the axle to prevent the drums from
sliding off. Cut four notches in the inner flange of each spool, as
shown, and pivot the catches <i>O</i>
to the post <i>L</i>, in the positions indicated, so they may be
thrown into the notches to lock the windlass (<a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Hoisting Cables</b> should be made of strong cord.
Fasten one end of the cable for raising the boom to a nail
(P, <a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>), and run this cord up and over the mast
pulley, then down through screw-eye <i>G</i> and over to one
drum; tie it securely to the drum so it will not slip around.
The other cable should be fastened between the nut and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
washer of the magnet, as shown in <a href="#fig_180">Fig. 180</a>, run up and
over the boom pulley <i>J</i>, then through screw-eye <i>G</i>, and
tied to the second drum.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_176">Figure 176</a> shows how the dry-cell may be strapped to
the base board in front of the mast, and how the wires
that connect the electro-magnet, switch, and cell should
be twisted around the hoisting cable, part way, and the
remainder of their length allowed to hang. Be sure to cut
the wires long enough to reach from a table-top down to
the floor. Use flexible wire if you can get it.</p>

<p>By mounting the base upon spool wheels, your derrick
can be moved along a table-top. Spool-ends may be used
for the wheels, and can either be screwed to the edge of
the base, or be fastened upon axles as the wheels of the
<i>Electric Motor Truck</i> are fastened (<a href="#fig_203">Figs. 203</a> and <a href="#fig_208">208</a>).</p>

<p><b>How the Derrick Works.</b> It is probably unnecessary to
explain that a load is picked up by throwing over the
switch lever to the contact point and closing the circuit,
and that it is dropped by throwing off the switch lever
and opening the circuit&mdash;which causes the electro-magnet
to lose its magnetism.</p>

<p><b>A Toy Shocking Machine.</b>.The little shocking machine
shown in <a href="#fig_187">Fig. 187</a> is a harmless toy with which you can
have an endless amount of fun when entertaining friends.
The shock it produces is not severe, but strong enough to
make your friend's arm and wrist muscles twitch, and
perhaps cause him to dance. Large shocking coils contract
the muscles to such an extent that it is impossible to let
go of the metal grips until the current has been shut off,
but in our small shocking machine the handles can be
dropped the instant the person holding them wishes to
do so.</p>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Figs. 188-191.</span>&mdash;Details of Induction-coil.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Induction-coil</b> is the first part to make. This is
shown in detail in <a href="#fig_188">Figs. 188</a> to <a href="#fig_191">191</a>. The coil has windings
of two sizes of wire upon an iron core. For the core buy
a 5/16-inch carriage-bolt 2&frac12; inches long, and for the wire
coils get some No. 20- or 24-gauge electric-bell insulated
copper wire, and some No. 30-gauge insulated magnet-wire.
To keep the wire from slipping off the ends of the
bolt core, cut two cardboard ends about 1&frac12; inches in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
diameter. Slip one of these on to the bolt next to the head,
and the other one next to the nut, as shown in <a href="#fig_188">Fig. 188</a>.</p>

<p>Three layers of the coarse wire should be wound on first,
for</p>

<p><b>The Primary-coil.</b> Pierce a hole through one cardboard
end, stick the wire through it, and allow about 5
inches to project upon the outside; then commence winding
the wire upon the core, placing each turn close to the
preceding turn. When the opposite end of the bolt has
been reached, wind back to the starting point, then work
back to the other end again. There will be in the neighborhood
of 175 turns in the three layers. Cut off the wire
so there will be a 5-inch projection, and stick the projecting
end through a hole in the cardboard end. This completes
the primary-coil (<a href="#fig_189">Fig. 189</a>).</p>

<p>Before winding the small wire on top of the primary-coil,
to form</p>

<p><b>The Secondary-Coil</b>, wrap the primary-coil with a layer
of bicycle tape, or glue several layers of paper around the
coil. Then wind on the small wire as you did the coarser
wire, being very careful to get it on evenly and smoothly.
Wind eleven layers on the coil, and run the end of the
eleventh layer out through the cardboard end (<a href="#fig_190">Fig. 190</a>).
There should be about 100 turns of this wire to the layer,
or 1100 turns in all.</p>

<p>A crank arrangement can be rigged up to make the
winding easier, but with patience, and by doing the work
slowly, the wire can be wound almost as well by hand.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
It is difficult to keep track of each preceding turn, while
winding, because of the fineness of the wire, and on this
account it is a good scheme to coat each layer with bluing
after it has been wound on, so that each turn of the following
layer will show plainly against the stained layer beneath
it. <a href="#fig_190">Fig. 190</a> shows the complete induction-coil.</p>

<p>Cut a base block 5 inches wide and 7 inches long, bevel
the top edges to give it a trim appearance, and mount the
induction-coil to one side of the center (<a href="#fig_187">Fig. 187</a>), strapping
it in place by means of two tin straps similar to that shown
in <a href="#fig_191">Fig. 191</a>, cut from a tin can.</p>

<p>The projecting ends of the primary-coil connect with the
battery, while the two ends of the secondary-coil connect
with the handles. Make three binding-post plates out of
folded pieces of tin, similar to plates <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, in <a href="#fig_182">Fig. 182</a>.
Tack two of these to the end of the base and connect the

near one end of the induction-coil and connect one primary-coil
wire to it (<a href="#fig_187">Fig. 187</a>).</p>

<p><b>For the Handles</b> take two pieces of broom-handle 3&frac12;
inches long, and cover each with a piece of tin (<a href="#fig_192">Fig. 192</a>).
The pattern for the tin covering (<a href="#fig_193">Fig. 193</a>) shows how tabs
are prepared on the ends and holes punched through them
for connecting with the induction-coil. The connecting
wires should be 5 or 6 feet long. Flexible wire is better than
bell-wire for these, because it is more easily handled in
passing the handles around. Tack the tin covering to the
pieces of broom-handle.</p>

<p>The purpose of the induction-coil is to raise the voltage
of the battery. The flow of current must be an interrupted
one, in order to shock, and therefore</p>

<p><b>An Interrupter</b> must be inserted between the battery
and one of the wires leading to the primary-coil of the induction-coil.
There are several ways to construct an interrupter, but
the scheme which I have invented for the model of
this shocking-machine (<a href="#fig_187">Fig. 187</a>)
serves the purpose nicely, and is a neat appearing
little piece of apparatus.
This interrupter is easily constructed as you will
see by the working details shown in <a href="#fig_194">Figs. 194</a> to <a href="#fig_198">198</a>.</p>

<p>Cut the base block <i>A</i> 1&frac12; inches wide and 2&frac12; inches long.
Make the shaft <i>B</i> 2&frac34; inches long and of a diameter equal
to the hole in a thread spool; and prepare the crank <i>C</i> to
fit on the end, and drive a brad into it for a handle. Fasten
the crank to the shaft with glue, or by driving a small
brad through the two. The shaft supports <i>D</i> should be
prepared as shown in <a href="#fig_196">Fig. 196</a>, 1&frac14; inches wide across the
bottom, <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide at the top, and 1&frac34; inches high. Bore
a hole through each, a little below the top, and large
enough so the shaft will turn easily, and fasten these supports
with brads to the sides of base <i>A</i>. Drive eight brads
into a thread spool, spacing them equidistant from one
another, and mount this spool upon the shaft (<i>E</i>, <a href="#fig_194">Fig. 194</a>),
first slipping the shaft through one support, then
through the spool, and then through the other support.
Drive the spool brads a trifle into the shaft to hold the
spool in position.</p>

<p>The projecting arm <i>F</i> (<a href="#fig_194">Fig. 194</a>) is a strip of tin cut from
a can, and must be long enough so each nail-head will strike
its end when spool <i>E</i> is revolved. Drive a nail into base
<i>A</i>, at <i>G</i>, and, after bending strip <i>F</i> as shown in <a href="#fig_198">Fig. 198</a>,
fasten it with brads upon the top of an upright made similar
to <i>H</i> (<a href="#fig_197">Fig. 197</a>), and nail this upright to the end of
base <i>A</i>. The upper end of strip <i>F</i> must be bent so it will
bear down upon the head of nail <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>The wire from the primary-coil which is as yet not connected
should be attached to nail <i>G</i>, and one battery wire
should be connected to a binding-post plate <i>I</i> fastened to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the lower end of strip <i>F</i>. <a href="#fig_198">Figure 198</a> shows how the binding-post
plate is made out of a doubled piece of tin, with a
hole punched through it for a small binding-screw.</p>

<p>This completes the interrupter. Mount it beside the
induction-coil upon the base block, and connect it with the
battery and the induction-coil, as shown in <a href="#fig_187">Fig. 187</a>. Connect
the battery cells in series. Two cells will be enough.</p>

<p><b>How the Interrupter Works.</b> When you turn the crank
of the interrupter, each nail in spool <i>E</i> raises the end of
strip <i>F</i>, in passing it, thus breaking the electrical contact
between it and the head of nail <i>G</i>. If the strip has been
bent properly, it will spring back into contact with the
head of nail <i>G</i>, and each time the contact is made,
the person holding the handles will receive a shock. The
strength of the current can be regulated somewhat by the
speed with which the interrupter crank is turned. The
shocks are stronger and more distinct when the crank is
turned slowly.</p>

<p>Home-made electrical toys of a light construction are
easily operated by a toy motor, when the motor and battery
cell are not carried by the toy; but when both are transported,
as in the case of a wagon, the construction must be
very carefully worked out, or the motor will not be powerful
enough to drive the wheels.</p>

<p><b>The Toy Electric Motor Truck</b> shown in <a href="#fig_199">Fig. 199</a> is of
light construction, the axle bearings produce very little
friction, and the battery is light and of a powerful type.</p>

<p>Get an oblong shaped cigar-box for the <i>bed</i> and <i>sides</i> of
the truck, several large thread spools for <i>wheels</i> and <i>pulleys</i>,
two small silk-thread spools, four lead-pencils, or sticks
whittled perfectly round and &frac14; inch in diameter, for <i>axles</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
<i>belt-shaft</i>, and <i>steering-wheel post</i>, and six screw-eyes 5/16
inch in diameter for the <i>bearings</i>.</p>

<p>First, place the cigar-box in a wash-boiler or wash-tub
of hot water, and allow it to remain there until the paper
labels have soaked off or loosened sufficiently so they can
be scraped off with a knife.</p>

<p>Then, after the box has thoroughly dried, cut the two
strips <i>A</i> (<a href="#fig_208">Fig. 208</a>), and fasten them to the bottom, one at
each side. Screw the screw-eye axle bearings into these
strips. Place them at equal distances from the ends of
the strips.</p>

<p><b>The Wheels</b> are made from the flange ends of the large
spools. <a href="#fig_202">Figure 202</a> shows the front pencil axle. Slip the
center portion of one of the large spools on to this for a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
pulley, then stick the pencil ends through the screw-eyes
in strips <i>A</i>, and glue the spool-end wheels on to them.
The rear axle is like the front one, with the spool pulley
omitted (<a href="#fig_203">Fig. 203</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Upper Shaft</b> shown in <a href="#fig_201">Fig. 201</a> supports a spool pulley like the one
on the front axle, and its screw-eye bearings should be screwed into the
top edge of the sides of the box (<a href="#fig_200">Fig. 200</a>), directly over the front
axle. Slip a silk-spool on to each end of this shaft to keep its ends
from slipping out of the screw-eyes.</p>

<p><b>The Belts.</b> As you will see by <a href="#fig_200">Figs. 200</a> to <a href="#fig_202">202</a>, the upper large pulley
is belted to the motor pulley, and another belt extends from the upper
shaft down to the pulley on the front axle. Rubber-bands make the best
belts. Cut a hole through the bottom of the cigar-box for the belt
extending from the upper shaft to the front axle to pass through. Screw
the toy motor to the cigar-box with its pulley directly in line with the
upper shaft pulley.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

<p><b>The Battery.</b> A dry battery is too heavy for the motor
truck to carry; so we must make a special two-cell battery
like that shown in <a href="#fig_204">Fig. 204</a>. Two glass tumblers to hold
the solution, a pair of battery zincs, a pair of carbons, and
a bi-chromate of potash solution, are needed. Old battery
zinc pencils with several inches of the eaten end cut off
(<a href="#fig_206">Fig. 206</a>) will do for the zincs, and the carbons from worn-out
dry-battery cells cut to a corresponding length will do
for the carbons. Fasten together the zincs and carbons
with rubber-bands, as shown in <a href="#fig_207">Fig. 207</a>, after wrapping
a piece of bicycle-tape around the upper end of the carbon
and inserting a small wad of it between the lower ends of
the carbons and zincs, to keep them from touching one
another.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_205">Figure 205</a> shows a completed cell, and <a href="#fig_204">Fig. 204</a> how the
two cells are connected in <i>series</i>, that is, with the carbon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of one connected to the zinc of the other. Twisting the
connecting wires into coils, as shown, is a good method of
taking up the slack.</p>

<p><b>The Bi-chromate Battery Fluid</b> is made up of bi-chromate
of potash, sulphuric acid, and water, in the following
proportions:</p>

<p style="text-indent:4em;">4 ounces of bi-chromate of potash</p>
<p style="text-indent:4em;">4 ounces of sulphuric acid</p>
<p style="text-indent:4em;">1 quart of water</p>

<p>In making up this solution, first add the acid to the water,&mdash;<i>never
add the water to the acid</i>&mdash;and then, when the
solution is nearly cool, add the bi-chromate of potash.
Pour the acid into the water slowly, because the combination
of the two creates a great deal of heat, and if the heat
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
forms too quickly your glass bottle is likely to split. Label
the bottle in which you put this solution POISON.</p>

<p>As the bi-chromate solution attacks the zinc element of
a cell even when the current is not being drawn upon, the
zinc should be removed when the cell is not in use.</p>

<p><b>Amalgamating a Zinc Pencil.</b> To reduce the eating
away of a zinc pencil used in a bi-chromate solution, the
zinc should be amalgamated by rubbing a thin coat of
mercury over its surface. Dip the zinc into the solution,
first, then with a rag
dipped in the solution rub
the mercury on to it.</p>

<p>Cut an opening through
the cigar-box large enough
for the two tumblers to set
in. Then cut a strip of tin
about 1 inch wide and 8
inches long, and bend it
into a U-shaped hanger,
to support the tumbler
bottoms. Slip the hanger
ends under strips <i>A</i>, bend
them against the sides of the box, and fasten with tacks
(<a href="#fig_208">Figs. 208</a> and <a href="#fig_209">209</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#fig_200">Figure 200</a> shows how the battery cells are connected.
A small switch can be fastened to the side of the truck
to shut off and turn on the current, but, instead, you can
simply withdraw one pair of elements from its tumbler to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
shut off the current. When through playing with the
truck, however, it is important to remove both pairs of
elements and wash them off, because the bi-chromate
solution attacks the zinc elements even when the current
is not in use. As the bi-chromate solution stains very
badly, it is advisable to operate the motor truck only
where there is no danger of ruining anything in case some
of the solution spills, as in the basement or workshop.
If you wish to use a dry-cell instead of the pair of bi-chromate
cells, you can place the cell upon the floor and
make the wires connecting it to the motor long enough so
the truck can run back and forth across a room.</p>

<h3>A HOME-MADE DOLL-HOUSE</h3>


<p>There is nothing more interesting to build than a doll-house,
and the construction is within the ability of the
average girl. If brother is willing to lend a hand with
the carpenter work so much the better. Sister can attend
to the finishing and furnishing, which are important parts
of the work that she can do more handily than a boy can.
But there is no reason why either a girl or boy cannot
undertake a doll-house like that shown in <a href="#fig_220">Figs. 220</a> and
<a href="#fig_221">221</a>, and carry the work to a successful completion, by
carefully following the instructions and diagrams in this
chapter.</p>

<p><b>The Building Material.</b> The doll-house in the photographs
was built of packing cases. You can buy these at
a dry-goods store at 15 or 20 cents apiece.</p>

<p><b>The Floor Plans</b> are shown in <a href="#fig_222">Figs. 222</a>, <a href="#fig_223">223</a>, and <a href="#fig_224">224</a>.
Your boxes may make it necessary to alter the dimensions
given, but that will be simple to do. Patterns for</p>

<p><b>The Partitions</b> are shown in <a href="#fig_225">Figs. 225</a> and <a href="#fig_226">226</a>. In
cutting the second-floor partitions (<a href="#fig_226">Fig. 226</a>), miter one edge
of <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> to allow for the bedroom door opening, shown
upon the plan, and miter the edges of _G_ to fit between
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
them above the door. The mitering is shown in the drawings
(<a href="#fig_226">Fig. 226</a>).</p>

<p>Besides cutting a stair opening in the second floor,
make an opening three by five inches in the second and
third floors for</p>

<p><b>The Elevator-shaft.</b> Care must be taken to have these
openings exactly over one another. Make the opening
in the second floor six by eight inches in the place indicated
upon the plan. This will allow for the elevator shaft
and stairway. No stairway has been built to the third
story, as the elevator serves the purpose, and one would
take up too much of the ball-room space.</p>

<p><b>The Side Walls</b> should measure nineteen inches wide
by twenty-four inches high, and the other two walls thirty
inches wide by twenty-four inches high. That portion of</p>

<p><b>The Rear Wall</b> enclosing the kitchen and bath-room is
hinged to open (see <a href="#fig_222">Fig. 222</a>), and</p>

<p><b>The Front Wall</b> is made in two sections, each hinged
to a strip of wood an inch and one-half wide nailed to the
two edges of the house, as shown in <a href="#fig_220">Fig. 220</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Windows</b> are four by five inches, so four-by-five
camera plates can be used for the glass.</p>

<p><b>The Roof</b> had best be made in two sections, each measuring
twenty-eight inches long by twenty-four inches wide.
Fasten the boards together with battens on the under side
and, after mitering the upper edge of each, nail them to
the house so that the ridge is fifteen inches above the third
floor. Then nail a board nineteen inches long by ten
inches wide in the peak of the roof (<i>D</i> in <a href="#fig_228">Fig. 228</a>), and a
narrow strip three inches from each side wall (<i>K</i> and <i>L</i>
in <a href="#fig_224">Fig. 224</a>). These cut off the triangular shape of the
ball-room and give it a better appearance.</p>

</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>

<p><b>The Chimney</b> is a solid block of wood with narrow strips nailed to all
sides near the top (<a href="#fig_227">Fig. 227</a>). Make it eight or ten inches long, and cut
off the bottom to fit the slant of the roof. Paint the block red, and
mark off the mortar joints in white.</p>

<p><b>An Elevator</b> is something which is found in but few doll-houses. It was
built in this house, thinking it might please the young mistress, and it
proved such a success that the scheme has been worked out carefully in
<a href="#fig_228">Figs. 228</a>, <a href="#fig_229">229</a>, <a href="#fig_230">230</a>, <a href="#fig_231">231</a>, and <a href="#fig_232">232</a>, that you may include it in the house
you build.</p>

<p>The cutting of the elevator-shaft has already been described. For
material, procure two small pulleys such as is shown in <a href="#fig_230">Fig. 230</a>, four
feet of brass chain, six feet of No. 12 wire, half a dozen
double-pointed tacks or very small screw-eyes, a short piece of lead
pipe, and a cigar-box. Make</p>

<p><b>The Car</b> out of the cigar-box, cutting it down to two
and one-quarter inches wide, three and three-quarters
inches deep, and seven inches high (see <a href="#fig_231">Fig. 231</a>). Place
two of the double-pointed tacks or screw-eyes in each side
of the car for the guide-wires to run through and another
in the center of the top from which to attach the brass
chain.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>


<p><b>The Guide-wires</b> are made of very heavy wire that will
not bend easily. Cut two of a length to reach from the
first floor to the ball-room ceiling, and after running them
through the tacks in the sides of the car, stick their ends
into small holes bored at <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>H</i> (<a href="#fig_228">Fig. 228</a>). The
upper holes should be bored through the ball-room ceiling,
while the lower ones need be bored but part way
through the first floor. Care must be taken to have
these holes in the correct position, so the elevator will
run up and down upon the wires without striking the sides
of the shaft. The easiest way of fastening the wires in
place is to run the upper ends through the holes, until the
lower ends can be set into their sockets, and then drive
two double-pointed tacks over the top of each wire, as
shown at <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> in <a href="#fig_228">Fig. 228</a>.</p>

<p>Now run the elevator up to the top of the shaft, and
mark upon the ceiling where the screw-eye in the top of
the car strikes. At this point bore a hole through the
ceiling and two inches back of it bore another hole, through
which to run the weight-chain. When this has been done,
cut a short block of wood to fit the peak of the roof and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Screw the Pulleys</b> into it two inches apart (<a href="#fig_229">Fig. 229</a>).
Fit the block in the peak of the roof, centering the front
pulley over the top of the car as nearly as possible, and
drive a couple of nails through the roof boards into it to
hold it in place temporarily. Then</p>

<p><b>Attach the Chain</b> to the tack in the top of the car, slip
a piece of lead pipe about an inch long over the chain,
allowing it to set on the top of the car to make the latter
heavier (<a href="#fig_231">Fig. 231</a>), and run the chain up through the first
hole in the ceiling, over the pulleys, and down through
the second hole. To the end of the chain attach a piece
of lead pipe for</p>

<p><b>The Counter-balance</b> (<i>C</i>, <a href="#fig_232">Fig. 232</a>). This should be
just heavy enough to make a perfect balance between
it and the car, which can be obtained by whittling off
the end of the pipe until the weight of the two is the same.
Make the chain of sufficient length so the weight will rest
upon the first floor when the car is at the third floor.
You can now tell whether or not the pulleys are in the
right positions. When they have been adjusted properly,
nail the block firmly in place.</p>

<p><b>The Gable-Ends.</b> The front gable-end consists of four
pieces (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>, in <a href="#fig_233">Fig. 233</a>), the dimensions for
the cutting of which are given in the illustration. After
preparing these, nail <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> in their proper positions
in the gable of the roof, and trim the edges of <i>D</i>, if they
need it, to fit between. To prevent the movable section
from pushing in too far, it will be necessary to nail a narrow
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
strip of wood to the roof and third floor, just inside of it.
The rear gable is made in one piece, and is fastened in
place permanently.</p>

</div>

<p>The movable gable and all hinged portions should have</p>

<p><b>Spring-catches</b> with which to shut up and lock the
house (see the illustrations).</p>

<p><b>The Stairway</b> is shown in <a href="#fig_228">Fig. 228</a>, and the details for its construction
will be found in <a href="#fig_234">Figs. 234</a>, <a href="#fig_235">235</a>, <a href="#fig_236">236</a>, <a href="#fig_237">237</a>. This stairway is made in two
parts, with a platform between. Cut a block of wood the shape and size
shown in <a href="#fig_234">Fig. 234</a> for the platform, with notches at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> for the
tops of the lower stringers to fit in. Then</p>

<p><b>Prepare Two Stringers</b> of thirteen steps similar to <a href="#fig_235">Fig. 235</a>,
and two stringers of five steps similar to <a href="#fig_236">Fig. 236</a>, laying off
the steps by means of a cardboard pattern, or <i>pitch-board</i>, of
the size shown in <a href="#fig_237">Fig. 237</a>. After cutting out these pieces,
fasten the tops of the lower stringers in the notches <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
in the platform, and nail the platform in its proper position in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the corner of the hall. When this has been done, nail the bottoms of the
upper stringers (<i>E</i> in <a href="#fig_236">Fig. 236</a>) to the sides of the platform at <i>C</i>
and <i>D</i> (<a href="#fig_234">Fig. 234</a>), and set the tops in notches cut in the edge of the
second floor.</p>

<p><b>The Treads and Risers</b> of the steps&mdash;the horizontal and vertical
boards&mdash;should be cut out of cigar-box wood.</p>

<p>Cut</p>

<p><b>The Newel-Posts</b> out of short square blocks, and</p>

<p><b>The Hand-rails</b> out of strips of cigar-box wood. Make a groove in the
under side of the hand-rails to receive the ends of</p>

<p><b>The Balusters</b>, or spindles. Toothpicks are of just the right size for
balusters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The delicate portions of the stairways should be glued
in place. Make slits in the stair treads to stick the bottoms
of the balusters in.</p>

<p><b>The Front Steps</b> are clearly shown in <a href="#fig_220">Fig. 220</a>. Make
the solid balustrades out of pieces of box board, and the
step treads and risers out of cigar-box wood. Prepare the
rear steps in the same way.</p>

<p><b>Cut the Window Openings</b> in the places indicated upon
the plans (<a href="#fig_222">Figs. 222</a> to <a href="#fig_224">224</a>) and the photographs. First
bore holes in the four corners of each window space; then
saw from hole to hole with a compass-saw.</p>

<p>Old camera plates are excellent material for</p>

<p><b>The Window Glass.</b> Fasten the glass in the openings
with small brads in the same way that glass is fastened in
picture-frames, and putty it in the same way that window
glass is puttied, to hold it firm.</p>

<p><b>The Front and Rear Doors</b> can be painted upon the
front of the house. Openings are not necessary.</p>

<p><b>The Outside Trimmings.</b> Strips of cigar-box wood
should be cut up for the outside door and window casings,
and be tacked around the openings as shown in <a href="#fig_220">Fig. 220</a>.
Nail a molding or a plain strip of wood to the front edge
of the third floor, as shown in <a href="#fig_220">Fig. 220</a>.</p>

<p><b>Castors</b> will make it easier to move the doll-house about.
Cut four blocks of wood, fasten a castor to each, and nail
one block inside each corner of the foundation frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Interior Woodwork.</b> Cigar-boxes make excellent
hardwood floors. Fit the pieces close together and fasten
with small brads.</p>

<p>Make the door and window casings, picture-moldings,
and baseboards out of strips of cigar-box wood.</p>

<p>After completing the carpenter work of the house,</p>

<p><b>Set the Nail-heads</b>,&mdash;that is, drive them below the
surface of the wood,&mdash;putty these holes and all cracks
and other defective places, and sandpaper rough surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Paint the House</b> a cream color, with white trimmings
and a green roof. Stripe the foundation walls to indicate
courses of stone work. Paint the front door a mahogany
color, with panels indicated upon it, and make the rear
door white. The painting of the chimney has already
been described.</p>

<p>The inside walls should be finished as suggested in
Chapter XIV. The woodwork may be oiled, or painted
with white enamel or any other color desired.</p>

<h3>FURNISHING THE HOME-MADE DOLL-HOUSE</h3>


<p>With the carpenter work of a doll-house completed,
the finishing of the inside,&mdash;wall papering and painting,&mdash;and
selecting of furnishings for the various rooms,
remain to be done. This requires as much care as the
building of the house, and while any boy can do the work,
the help of a sister will perhaps simplify matters and give
to the rooms a daintier appearance.</p>

<p><b>The Walls and Ceiling</b> of the kitchen and bath-room
should be painted with white lead or white enamel. For
the other rooms select paper having a small design, such
as is to be found on most ceiling papers. If you have
ever watched the paper-hanger at work, you have noticed
he puts on the ceiling first, allowing the paper to run
down the walls a little way all around instead of trimming
it off. Then he hangs the wall paper, and if there
is no border to cover the joints of the ceiling and wall
papers he carries the wall paper up to the ceiling. Use
flour paste to stick on the paper, and a cloth or photograph-print
roller to smooth out the wrinkles. The dining-room
should have a wainscot of dark paper below the
chair-rail, and a paper with little or no figure upon it above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p><b>All Hardwood Floors</b>, the stairs, door and window
casings, baseboards, and picture moldings should be
varnished thoroughly or given several coats of boiled
linseed-oil.</p>

<p>All floors, with the exception of the kitchen, bath-room,
and hardwood floors, should be fitted with</p>

<p><b>Carpets.</b> If you do not happen to have suitable scraps
on hand, they can be procured at almost any furnishing
store where they make up carpets. Select pieces with as
small patterns as possible. The floors of the bath-room
and kitchen should be covered with oilcloth.</p>

<p><b>Rugs</b> for the hardwood floors may be made out of scraps
of carpet.</p>

<p><b>Window-shades</b> may be made for each window out of
linen, and tacked to the top casing so that the bottom of
the curtain reaches just above the center of the opening.
Each window should also have</p>

<p><b>Lace Curtains</b> made out of scraps of lace. They should
either be tacked above the windows or hung upon poles
made out of No. 12 wire, cut in lengths to fit the windows.
Screw small brass hooks into the top window-casings for
the poles to hang upon.</p>

<p><b>Handsome Portières</b> for the doorways can be made with
beads and with the small hollow straws sold for use in
kindergartens. For the</p>

<p><b>Bead Portières</b>, cut threads as long as the height of the
door and string the beads upon them, alternating the
colors in such a way as to produce patterns. Then tie
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the strings together to a piece of wire the width of the
doorway, and fasten the wire in the opening. The</p>

<p><b>Straw Portières</b> are made similarly.</p>

<p>From magazine illustrations you can select</p>

<p><b>Suitable Pictures</b> for each room, but if you are handy
with brush and pencil you may prefer to make the pictures
yourself. These may be mounted upon cardboard and
have their edges bound with passe-partout paper to give
the effect of frames, or frames may be cut out of cardboard
and pasted to them. Hang the pictures to the
picture molding with thread.</p>

<p><b>A Cosey-corner</b> may be fitted up in the ball-room by
fastening a strip of a cigar-box in one corner an inch and
one-half above the floor for the seat, and hanging draperies
on each side of it. Pillows may be made for it out of
scraps of silk stuffed with cotton.</p>

<p>A doll-house properly proportioned in every detail, including
the selection of its furniture, is pleasing to look at,
and is to be desired much more than some of the specimens
to be found in the stores. These very often have
parlor chairs larger than the mantel, beds that either fill
two-thirds of the bedroom space or are so small they are
hidden from view by the chairs, and other furniture accordingly,
all having been selected without any thought as
to size or fitness.</p>

<p>Care must be taken, in buying the furniture, to have
the pieces suitable to the rooms. It will no doubt require
more time than to purchase the first sets you come across,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
but when you have completed the selections, the result
will be a much better appearing doll-house.</p>

<p>By carefully searching the toy-shops you are almost
certain of finding what you want for the various rooms,
as about everything imaginable in furniture has been
manufactured. Porcelain bath-tubs, wash-basins with
real faucets and running water, gilt furniture, chandeliers,
and such articles are tempting to buy. But it is
rather expensive to fit up a house in this way, for, though
each piece may not amount to very much, they count up
very quickly.</p>

<p>The suggestions for the making of cigar-box furniture
in Chapter XVII, and spool and cardboard furniture in
Chapter XIX, will give you plenty of material for furniture
and save you the expense of buying this part of the
furnishings for your house.</p>

window in the center of <i>D</i>, and fasten the glass
in place with strips cut as described in Chapter XIII.
Strips should be nailed to the roof just inside of the movable
section to prevent the latter from setting in too far,

the movable section
in place.</p>

<h3>A HOME-MADE DOLL APARTMENT BUILDING</h3>


<p>The doll apartment building in this chapter is a new
idea in doll-houses. By the illustrations you will see that
the apartment building is three stories high, and consists
of three units&mdash;each one story high&mdash;and a roof. During
playtime the units are arranged side by side upon the
floor so as to form a six-room apartment (<a href="#fig_244">Fig. 244</a>); and
afterward they are piled up one upon another as shown
in <a href="#fig_243">Fig. 243</a>, and the roof placed on top, in a compact form
that takes up but little floor space.</p>

<p><b>Building Material.</b> The apartment building is built out
of grocery boxes. The boxes used for the units must be
of equal size, and the thing to do is to select those in
which a standard brand of goods come packed. If one
grocery store doesn't have what you want, go to another.
If the sides and ends of the boxes are in one piece, it will
greatly simplify the matter of cutting the door and window
openings.</p>

<p><b>The Room Dimensions.</b> The boxes used in the model
illustrated were 28 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 8
inches deep. These provided space for a vestibule 3
inches by 8 inches, a reception-hall 8&frac12; inches by 8 inches,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
a living-room 12 inches by 18&frac12; inches, a dining-room 12
inches by 15 inches, a kitchen 12 inches by 8 inches, a
pantry 7 inches by 3 inches, two bedrooms&mdash;one 12 inches
square and the other 12 inches by 8 inches, and a bathroom
7&frac12; inches by 6 inches (<a href="#fig_245">Fig. 245</a>). You may have to
vary the sizes of your rooms a trifle, if you get boxes of
different proportions, but it is probable that you can keep
to the same plan arrangement.</p>

<p><b>Mark the Door and Window Openings</b> carefully upon
the sides of the box, making them as nearly as possible in
the same proportion to the wall space as is shown in the
illustrations. Then, in cutting the openings, bore a number
of small holes a trifle inside of the lines, to make an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
opening large enough to insert a small keyhole-saw or
bracket-saw, and the cutting will be easy to do.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 249.</span>&mdash;In Cutting the Opening for the Bay Windows, leave a Narrow Strip
over the Opening, as above, for a &quot;Beam.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Bay Windows</b> on the second and third stories are built of cigar-box
wood. Instead of cutting away the entire width of the box at the points
of attaching these bays, it is a better plan to leave a narrow strip
over the opening, as shown in <a href="#fig_249">Fig. 249</a>. This will hold the walls
together, and will form a "beam" across the ceiling. The side edges of
the pieces that form the front of the bay must be slanted off so as to
fit at the proper angles, and the window openings must be cut carefully,
because the margin of wood around them is narrow and will split easily.
Fasten together the members of the bays, also the inside partitions,
with glue and brads.</p>

<p><b>The Joints between the Units</b>, when piled one upon
another, are concealed by a band of wood &frac12; inch wide
nailed around the front and two ends of the bottom of
the second and third story units (<a href="#fig_247">Figs. 247</a> and <a href="#fig_248">248</a>).
These bands should project about &frac14; inch below the bottoms
of these boxes, so as to set down over the boxes beneath.
They must not extend around the back of the boxes, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
cannot be fastened to the first story box, because they
would interfere with placing the boxes close together as
in <a href="#fig_244">Fig. 244</a>.</p>

<p>The first story unit must be raised to the same floor
level as the other stories, however, and a thin board of
the same thickness as the projection of the strips on the
second and third story units must be nailed to its bottom
to bring it to the same level (<a href="#fig_246">Fig. 246</a>).</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 252.</span>&mdash;How the Chimney and Chimney Cap are Made.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Roof Construction</b> is shown in <a href="#fig_250">Fig. 250</a>. Boards
<i>H</i> (<a href="#fig_250">Figs. 250</a> and <a href="#fig_251">251</a>) should be cut of the right size to
form a projection of 1&frac12; inches over the front and ends of
the building, and the piece <i>I</i> should be cut to the proper
shape and size to form an equal projection over the bay
windows. Strips <i>J</i> and <i>K</i> are 1 inch wide, and should
be fastened to boards <i>H</i> so they will come exactly over the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
front and end walls when the roof is set in place. Block
<i>L</i> should be cut of such a shape and size that when nailed
to strip <i>K</i> its front edges will come directly over the walls
of the bay windows. A narrow strip nailed to the under
side of the roof boards, close against the walls, will conceal
the joint between the roof and top story and make a
good finish molding.</p>

<p><b>The Chimney</b> is made of two blocks (<i>M</i> and <i>N</i>, <a href="#fig_252">Fig. 252</a>).
Notch the lower block to fit over strip <i>J</i>, and cut
the cap block large enough to project <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch all around.</p>

<p><b>The Windows.</b> Old photograph plates can be cut down
to the proper sizes for the window openings, but it will not
cost much to have the paint-shop man cut them out of
new material, if you haven't any. The glass should be
just a trifle smaller than the openings. Fasten it in place
with narrow strips of cigar-box wood. Window sashes
can be indicated by striping the glass with black paint.</p>

<p><b>Make the Front Door</b> out of a piece of cigar-box wood,
and set a piece of glass in an opening cut about the size
shown in <a href="#fig_243">Fig. 243</a>. This door may be hinged to open,
but it is better to fasten it in the opening, because small
pieces are easily broken off their hinges. Fasten a small
block below the front door for a step (<a href="#fig_243">Fig. 243</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Inside Doorways</b>, in the ends of the first story
unit and in the back of the second and third story units,
may be fitted with pieces of board that can be set in when
the units are piled up in the form of the building, but it
is not necessary to make this provision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Interior Trim.</b> The door and window casings,
picture moldings, baseboards, and other trimming should
be made out of strips of cigar-box wood. Tack the strips
in place with short brads.</p>

<p><b>A Fireplace</b> must be provided for the living-room, and
one easily constructed out of four pieces of wood is shown
in <a href="#fig_253">Figs. 253</a> and <a href="#fig_254">254</a>. Cut blocks <i>O</i> and <i>P</i> of the same
thickness, and make the shelf piece <i>Q</i> of the proper size
to project an equal distance over the front and ends.
Fasten the pieces together, then glue red paper to the wood,
and when this has dried mark off brick courses with a
pencil. The joints may be accentuated by striping with
white or black paint.</p>

<p><b>Lighting Fixtures</b>, simple to make, are shown in two
splendid forms in <a href="#fig_255">Figures 255</a> and <a href="#fig_257">257</a>. Small brass
screw-hooks such as are shown in <a href="#fig_256">Figure 256</a> can be pur
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>chased
at any hardware store, and a couple of dozen of
these, a lead pencil, and a number of large beads, will
furnish you with enough material for making fixtures for
every room in the apartment.</p>

<span class="smcap">Figs. 255-258.</span>&mdash;Two Lighting Fixtures and how to Make Them.</p>
</div>

<p>You will see by <a href="#fig_256">Fig. 256</a> that the lighting fixture shown in <a href="#fig_255">Fig. 255</a>
consists of a screw-hook with its hooked end stuck through one of the
little brass plates removed from another screw-hook, and then pushed
into the hole in the end of a short piece of lead-pencil. Cut the pencil
end about &frac12; inch long, push out the piece of lead, and if
necessary enlarge the hole to accommodate the hook end. If the piece of
pencil comes apart where glued, re-glue it. Glue the little brass cap to
the top. Paint the pencil end white, to represent glass, and indicate
metal division strips, or <i>leading</i>, with black paint or ink.</p>

<p>The lighting fixture shown in <a href="#fig_257">Fig. 257</a> is made in the same way as the
other one, except that a bead instead of the pencil end is used for a
globe (<a href="#fig_258">Fig. 258</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The fixture in <a href="#fig_255">Fig. 255</a> is better suited to the living-room
and dining-room, and for fastening each side of the
front door; the fixture in <a href="#fig_257">Fig. 257</a> is better for the other
rooms.</p>

<p><b>Decorating.</b> Suggestions for decorating a doll-house are
given in Chapter XIV, but here are some additional ideas
to suit the conditions of the apartment. It is the modern
practice to tint walls of apartments, and the best plan is
to cover the walls of each room with plain paper, using a
paper of a different color for each room.</p>

<p>The dining-room should have a plate-rail on which to
stand plates (pictures of plates cut from advertisements
and pasted upon cardboard), and the walls below the
plate-rail should be paneled with strips of cigar-box wood
for division strips (<a href="#fig_244">Fig. 244</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Outside Walls</b> of the apartment building are supposedly
brick; therefore paint them a good red, brown, or
yellow brick color, and paint the roof cornice, and the
horizontal bands between stories, white, as a contrast.</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE DOLL FURNITURE</h3>


<p>The metal furniture which you can buy is very pretty
when it is new, but this new appearance does not last
long after it has come into a youngster's possession, for
the pieces are very slender and delicate, and thus easily
broken.</p>

<p>Wooden furniture is the most durable kind, and plain
and simple pieces will generally outlast the fancy ones.
The designs illustrated in this chapter make very substantial
pieces, as there are no spindle legs or fancy arms to
break off. They follow the lines of the mission furniture,
that simple style used in the early American mission
schools, and which is to-day being extensively made in
handsome pieces for the furnishings of modern homes.
You will find the</p>

<p><b>Miniature Mission Furniture</b>, illustrated and described
in this chapter, simple to make and something which is
easy to sell, for there is nothing like it at present upon
the market.</p>

<p>Cigar-boxes furnish the nicest material for making this
furniture, and the various parts can be cut to the right
shape and size with</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Scroll-Saw.</b> Procure small brads and glue with
which to fasten the pieces together.</p>

<p><b>To Prepare the Cigar-boxes</b> for use, place them in a tub
of boiling water and let them remain there until the paper
labels readily pull off. Do not use a knife in removing
the paper, as it is likely to roughen the wood. The paper
will come off by allowing it to soak long enough. When
the boxes are clean, set them in the sun to dry, after binding
the covers to the backs to prevent them from warping.
Pull the boxes apart when they are thoroughly dry,
and throw out such pieces as have printing upon them, for
these would spoil the appearance of the furniture if used.</p>

<p>In order to simplify the matter of cutting the parts
that make the furniture, the curved pieces have been
drawn out carefully on <a href="#Page_177">page 177</a>, so that they can be laid
off upon the strips of cigar-boxes without any trouble, by
the process of</p>

<p><b>Enlarging by Squares.</b> These drawings are shown
one-quarter of their full size (half their width and half
their height). To enlarge them procure a piece of cardboard
nine by thirteen inches, or a little larger than twice
the size of the drawing each way, and divide it into squares
just twice the size of those on <a href="#Page_177">page 177</a>. That will make
sixteen squares in the width of the cardboard and twenty-four
in the length, each half an inch square. In order to
get the squares spaced equally, it is best to lay off the
points first with a ruler along the top, bottom, and two
sides of the sheet of cardboard, and then connect the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
points with the ruler and a sharp lead-pencil. Then
number the squares as in the illustration, using the figures
along the sides and letters across the top and bottom of the
sheet.</p>

<p>With the sheet of cardboard thus prepared it is a simple
matter to</p>

<p><b>Reproduce the Drawings</b> of <a href="#fig_259">Figs. 259</a> to <a href="#fig_266">266</a> by locating
the points of the curves and corners of the pieces, as
shown in the illustrations, in corresponding positions in
the squares on your cardboard sheet. The curves may be
drawn in by eye, after locating them with reference to
their surrounding squares, but the surest way of enlarging
them accurately is by laying off the points where the
curve strikes each horizontal and vertical line in the illustration,
upon the enlarged drawing. These points can
then be connected with a curved line.</p>

<p>Make all of the lines heavy so they can be distinguished

<p>We will first note the construction of</p>

<p><b>The Chairs</b> shown in <a href="#fig_267">Figs. 267</a> and <a href="#fig_268">268</a>. These are
four and one-half inches high, two inches wide, and an
inch and one-half deep. Cut the back for the chair in
<a href="#fig_267">Fig. 267</a> four and three-eighths inches high and an inch
and three-quarters wide, the sides by the pattern in <a href="#fig_259">Fig. 259</a>
and the seat an inch and one-quarter by an inch and
three-quarters. With the pieces cut out, fasten them
together with brads and glue, placing the seat between
the arms and back so that it is an inch and one-half above
the base.</p>

one-half inches high by two inches wide, the seat an inch
and a quarter by an inch and three-quarters, and the sides
an inch and three-eighths wide by two and one-half high.
To get the curve in the bottom edge of the side pieces, use
the pattern in <a href="#fig_259">Fig. 259</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Settee</b> (<a href="#fig_269">Fig. 269</a>) should have its sides cut by the
pattern of <a href="#fig_260">Fig. 260</a>. Make the back piece three and three-quarters

<p><b>Tables</b> for the living-room, dining-room, bedroom, ball-room, and nursery
of a doll-house may be patterned after the designs of <a href="#fig_270">Figs. 270</a> and <a href="#fig_271">271</a>.
These should be two and one-half inches high to be of proper proportion
for the chairs.</p>

<p>The pieces necessary to make <a href="#fig_270">Fig. 270</a> are a top two inches square, two
sides an inch and one-half wide by two and one-half inches high, and a
shelf an inch and one-quarter square. Fasten the pieces together as in
the illustration, placing the shelf between the side pieces an inch from
the bottom.</p>

<p>The other design (<a href="#fig_271">Fig. 271</a>) will do nicely for</p>

<p><b>A Dining-room Table</b>, or table for the center of the
living-room. The top of this should be five inches long
and three inches wide. Cut the side pieces by the pattern
in <a href="#fig_261">Fig. 261</a> and, after fastening them to the under side of
the table-top four inches apart, brace them with a strip
three and three-quarters inches long by half an
inch wide, as shown in <a href="#fig_271">Fig. 271</a>.</p>

<p><b>A Side-board</b> similar to <a href="#fig_272">Fig. 272</a> should be made for the dining-room. The
pattern for the side pieces is shown in <a href="#fig_262">Fig. 262</a>. After sawing these
out, cut a piece seven inches long by three inches wide for the back and
fasten the side pieces to the edges of it. The location of the shelves
can be obtained best by referring to <a href="#fig_272">Fig. 272</a> and the pattern in <a href="#fig_262">Fig. 262</a>.
Cut the bottom shelf (<i>A</i> in <a href="#fig_272">Fig. 272</a>) three inches long by an inch
and one-quarter wide and fasten it to the side pieces half an inch above
the base (line 24 on pattern, <a href="#fig_262">Fig. 262</a>). Make shelf <i>B</i> three by one
inches and place it at line 22. <i>C</i> should be three and three-quarters
inches long by an inch and one-half wide, with a small notch cut near
each end with your knife, to make it fit over the side pieces (see
illustration).
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Cut shelf <i>D</i> three inches long by half an inch wide, fastening it in
place at line No. 17, <i>E</i> three inches long by seven-sixteenths of an
inch wide, fastening it at line No. 15, and <i>F</i> three inches long by
three-eighths of an inch wide, fastening it at line No. 13. The top
shelf (<i>G</i>) is three and three-quarters inches long and half an inch
wide and is fastened to the tops of the side pieces as shown in the
drawing.</p>

<p>The lower portion of the side-board is inclosed with two
doors two inches high by an inch and one-half wide. Small pieces
of cloth may be used for hinges, but it is better to use pins, running
them through the shelf above and below (<i>A</i> and <i>C</i>,
<a href="#fig_272">Fig. 272</a>) into the doors. Stick
the pins near the edge of the doors and see that they are
straight, so the doors will open easily. A small mirror attached
to the back between shelves <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> will complete this
piece of furniture.</p>

one of these will be seen in <a href="#fig_273">Fig. 273</a>. For its construction
cut two sides by means of the pattern in <a href="#fig_263">Fig. 263</a>, a
piece five inches long by three inches wide for the back,
and a strip three inches long by three-eighths of an inch
wide for a shelf. Fasten the sides to the edges of the
back piece, and the shelf between the sides about three-quarters
of an inch above the base. Now procure a mirror
such as you can buy in a toy-shop for
five or ten cents (or a piece of a
broken mirror cut down to the right
size will do very nicely), and attach it
to the center of the back.</p>

<p><b>The Grandfather's Clock</b> (<a href="#fig_274">Fig. 274</a>)
makes an effective piece of furniture
for the hall or living-room, and is
easily made. <a href="#fig_264">Figure 264</a> shows the
pattern for the front of this clock.
The back is made the same, with the
omission of the square opening cut in
the front frame for the clock-face. Cut
a block of wood two by two by three-quarters
inches to fit between the frames at the top.
After nailing the pieces together, procure a face from a
toy watch, and fasten it in the opening made for it in the
front frame. A button suspended by means of a piece
of thread from a tack placed in the bottom of the block
forms the pendulum.</p>

<p><b>Kitchen Furniture</b>, such as chairs and tables, for these can also be made
out of cigar-box wood similar to the designs illustrated in this
chapter, with perhaps a few modifications which will make them simpler.</p>

<p>Now for the making of some pieces of bedroom furniture. You will find in
<a href="#fig_275">Figs. 275</a> and <a href="#fig_276">276</a> two designs that are easily carried out, one or both
of which may be used for</p>

<p><b>The Beds</b> of a doll-house. To make <a href="#fig_275">Fig. 275</a>, cut the head and foot by
means of the pattern in <a href="#fig_265">Fig. 265</a>, and cut the two sides by means of the
pattern in <a href="#fig_266">Fig. 266</a>. After preparing these pieces and fastening them
together as shown in the illustration (<a href="#fig_275">Fig. 275</a>), cut a few strips a
quarter of an inch wide for slats and fasten them between the sides of
the bed. It is advisable to fasten these in place to prevent them from
being lost.</p>

<p>The side pieces for the other bed (<a href="#fig_276">Fig. 276</a>) are cut out with the same
pattern (<a href="#fig_266">Fig. 266</a>).</p>

<p>Make the head and foot pieces three by four and one-half
inches, cutting a piece two by an inch and one-quarter out
of the top of each as shown in the drawing (<a href="#fig_276">Fig. 276</a>6), and
using the pattern of the other bed for cutting the curve in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the bottom edge. Nail the pieces together in their proper
places, after which cut some slats and fasten them in the
bottom.</p>

<p><b>The Dresser</b> (<a href="#fig_277">Fig. 277</a>) is made somewhat similar to the side-board. Cut
the sides by the same pattern (<a href="#fig_262">Fig. 262</a>) and fasten them to the edges of
the back piece, which should be six and one-half inches high by three
inches wide. Cut shelf <i>A</i> three by one and one-quarter inches, <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i> three by one and one-eighth, <i>D</i> three by one and three-sixteenths,
and <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> one-half by one and one-quarter inches. Fasten shelf <i>A</i>
between the sides at line No. 24 (see <a href="#fig_262">Fig. 262</a>), <i>B</i> at line No. 23, <i>C</i>
at line No. 22, <i>D</i> at line No. 21, and notch the ends of <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> to
fit over the side pieces at line No. 20.</p>

<p>Drawers to fit the lower shelves of the dresser may be made out of small
strips of cigar-boxes or pieces of cardboard, glued together. A small
mirror fastened in the position shown in the drawing will complete the
work upon this piece of furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Wash-Stand</b> can be made for the bathroom and each of the bedrooms
similar to <a href="#fig_278">Fig. 278</a>. The sides for this should be five inches high by an
inch and one-quarter wide, and the shelves one by three inches. Fasten
the lower shelf three-quarters of an inch above the base, and the top
shelf at a height of two and one-half inches. When the stand has been
put together, fit a round stick, about an eighth of an inch in diameter,
in holes made in the sides with a gimlet (see illustration). This forms
the towel-rack. Hang a small drapery over the lower portion of the s
tand.</p>

<p><b>Finishing.</b> When the pieces of furniture have been completed, they
should be rubbed down with emery-paper to remove the rough edges,
and also any rough places that may have been caused by soaking the
boxes in water. Then give the wood several coats of linseed-oil. This makes a beautiful
finish for this kind of wood, which may be improved by
adding a coat of wax. The little hearts may be painted
upon the pieces as shown in the illustration, with a small
brush and red paint, or may be cut out of red paper and
glued to the wood.</p>

<p>If desired, the bedroom furniture may be painted with
white enamel.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#fig_279">Figs. 279</a> and <a href="#fig_282">Fig. 282</a> will be found some pieces of furniture that are
simpler to make than those just described, and although they may not be
so pretty, they present a very good appearance when neatly made.</p>

<p>The author constructed many pieces of this furniture when a boy, and
found them suitable as presents, and something that was always easy to
sell.</p>

<p>The cost of making a set amounts to but a few cents, cigar-boxes being
the principal material. They are also very quickly made, as the boxes
require but little cutting.</p>

<p>For the construction of</p>

<p><b>A Folding-bed</b>, such as
is shown in <a href="#fig_279">Figs. 279</a> and <a href="#fig_280">280</a>, select two cigar-boxes, one of
which will fit inside the other. The smaller box should be
a little shorter than the inside opening of the larger box.</p>

<p>After removing the paper from each, place the smaller box
inside the larger one, as shown in <a href="#fig_279">Fig. 279</a>, so that the bottom
of the inner box is flush with the edge of the outer box.
Then drive a brad through both boxes on each side, about
three-quarters of an inch from the end as shown at <i>A</i> (<a href="#fig_279">Fig. 279</a>).
These brads should run through the outer box into
the bottom of the inner box, and should be driven in carefully
so as not to split the wood. The inner box should now fold
down as shown in <a href="#fig_280">Fig. 280</a>, moving upon the brad pivots.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Purchase a five or ten cent mirror and fasten it to the front
of the bed, after which cut two wooden feet similar to
<a href="#fig_281">Fig. 281</a> and glue the pegs on the ends of these in gimlet
holes made above the mirror. Finish the wood the same as
described for the other cigar-box furniture.</p>

<p><b>The Dresser</b> shown in <a href="#fig_282">Fig. 282</a> is made out of a box the
same size as the larger one used for the folding-bed.
Saw the sides of the box in half, crosswise, and remove
the upper half and the end piece. Then nail the end across
the tops of the remaining halves of the sides. When this
has been done, divide up the lower portion of the box into
compartments as shown in the drawing (<a href="#fig_283">Fig. 283</a>). This
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
should have a small drapery hung over it. The upper
portion of the dresser should have a mirror attached to it,
and some lace draped over the top and sides will add greatly
to its appearance.</p>

<p>All you will have to do in making</p>

<p><b>A Wardrobe</b> will be to fasten some small hooks inside of
a cigar-box, attach the cover with a strip of linen&mdash;the
same way it was attached before you soaked it off&mdash;and
hang a mirror on the front.</p>

<p>These pieces of furniture were designed for separate
sets, and would not do for doll-houses the size of those in
the preceding chapters, unless the boxes were cut down to
smaller proportions.</p>

<h3>HOME-MADE CIGAR-BOX TOYS</h3>


<p>Cigar-boxes are splendid material for a variety of home-made
toys. In this chapter are shown some easily constructed
wagons, a Jack-in-the-box, a cradle, and several
tables and chairs of a different pattern from the doll
furniture for which working drawings were given in the
preceding chapter.</p>

<p>Get an assortment of shapes and sizes of boxes at a
cigar store, and prepare them for use as directed on <a href="#Page_175">page 175</a>.
Use <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch and &frac12; inch brads, and glue, for fastening
the pieces together.</p>

<p>A scroll-saw, bracket-saw, coping-saw, or a very sharp
jack-knife should be used where</p>

<p><b>Cutting</b> is necessary. Do not attempt to split the
wood, as the grain is seldom straight, but lay it down upon
a board and <i>score</i> it with a knife in the way in which you
would score a piece of cardboard; then break it along the
scored line, or continue cutting until the piece is cut in
two. If you use a saw, cut a little away from the outlines
of the work and then trim up with a knife and sandpaper.</p>

<p>The wagons, Jack-in-the-box, and doll furniture shown
in this chapter were designed with the idea of saving as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
much cutting as possible, and you will see by the illustrations
that in many cases the boxes are not altered.</p>

<p><b>The Express-wagon</b> shown in <a href="#fig_284">Fig. 284</a> is made out of a long flat box. Cut
down the sides at the front and construct a seat on top of the sides as
shown in <a href="#fig_286">Fig. 286</a>. Cut the front wheels about 2&frac14; inches in
diameter and the rear wheels about 2&frac34; inches in diameter. If you
haven't a compass with which to describe the circles, you can mark out
the wheels with cups or glass tumblers. Cut the wooden axles as shown in
<a href="#fig_286">Fig. 286</a>, making the front axle&mdash;for the smaller
wheels&mdash;deeper than the rear one, then fasten them to the wagon and
nail the wheels to their ends. Drive a tack into the front of the
wagon-box and tie a cord to it, or, if you have a small toy horse to
hitch to the wagon, fasten a pair of shafts to the under side of the box
as is shown upon the two-wheel cart.</p>

<p><b>The Cart</b> in <a href="#fig_285">Fig. 285</a> is made out of a square flat box
with its wheels fastened to the center of the under side.

<p><b>The Auto Delivery-wagon</b> (<a href="#fig_287">Figs. 287</a> and <a href="#fig_288">288</a>. See <i>Frontispiece</i>)
requires two boxes 8&frac12; inches long, 5 inches wide, and
2&frac12; inches deep. You will see by the illustrations that one
box is inverted upon the other. Before fastening them
together, remove the two ends of the upper box and the
rear end of the lower box (leaving the front end for the
<i>dashboard</i>), and cut 2 inches off the sides at the front and an
additional piece 1 inch by 1&frac34; inches from the sides of the
upper box for windows. Fasten the boxes together by
nailing strips to the ends of side pieces. Nail a narrow strip
across the top of the rear end of the wagon and hinge a
drop <i>end-gate</i> to the wagon-bed with cloth strips. Support
the end-gate with a cloth strap. Tack a curtain of
black cloth to the top cross strip and sew two cloth straps
to the curtain, so that it may be fastened up in a roll, as
shown in the photograph. Make the wheels and axles like
those of the express wagon, but cut the front and rear
wheels, also the two axles, of equal size. Cut out a small
steering-wheel and fasten it on a short wooden rod inside of
the dashboard. Make a seat and seat back, nail the back
to the seat, and then fasten the seat between the sides
of the wagon just below the windows.</p>

<p><b>A Jack-in-the-box</b> (<a href="#fig_289">Fig. 289</a>) is a simpler toy to make
than you might imagine. The box should measure about
5&frac34; inches by 5&frac34; inches by 5 inches. Hinge the cover to
the top with two pieces of heavy cloth; glue one piece to
the inside of the cover and box, and the other to the outside.
Drive a small tack into the front edge of the cover, and
below it fasten a small hook on to the box; the hook may
be bent from a short piece of wire.</p>

<p>A spiral spring from an old bed-spring will do for Jack's
body, but if you cannot get one of these it is a simple
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
matter to make a spring. Take a piece of No. 12 gauge wire about 10 feet
in length and wind it around a rolling-pin or anything that is
cylindrical and about 2&frac12; inches in diameter. Fasten this spring
with doubled-pointed tacks upon a piece of wood cut to fit the inside of
the box (<a href="#fig_290">Fig. 290</a>), then procure a small doll's head, baste a circular
piece of cardboard to the top of the spring and to this sew the head.
Make a cloth fool's cap to glue on Jack's head, covering his hair
entirely, and also a loose jacket to fit over his spiral body; for these
use any bright-colored cotton cloth that will fall into folds easily.
Tack the base of the spring to the bottom of the box.</p>

<p>All that is required for making the little toys shown in
this chapter are spools, cardboard, paper, a straight-grained
stick out of which to cut pegs, some tacks, pins, and glue.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a better model of</p>

<p><b>A Baby Carriage</b> than that shown in <a href="#fig_299">Fig. 299</a>, with its
rounded ends, arched bottom, and adjustable hood? It is
easy to make.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_300">Figure 300</a> shows the details for constructing the carriage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
body. Cut four wooden pegs to fit loosely in the holes of
four spools of equal size, and make them of the right length
so when slipped into the holes their ends will project about
&frac14; inch beyond the spool ends. Then cut the bottom strip
<i>B</i> 5 inches long by the width of the spools, bend it slightly
as shown, to give a curve to the carriage bottom, and
tack the ends of the strip to two of the spools (<i>A</i>).</p>

<p>Before fastening the side pieces to spools <i>A</i>, you must
attach the wheels (<a href="#fig_301">Figs. 301</a> and <a href="#fig_302">302</a>). Cut the cardboard
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
uprights <i>D</i> 3&frac12; inches long and &frac12; inch wide; then after
cutting holes through each near the ends, for the spool pegs
to slip through, cut down the width between the holes to
about &frac14; inch (<a href="#fig_302">Fig. 302</a>). Slip the lower ends of uprights <i>D</i>
over the pegs in spool wheels <i>E</i>, then the upper ends over
the pegs in spools <i>A</i>. Glue the upper ends to the ends of

<h3>A HOME-MADE TOY MAIL-BOX</h3>


<p>Who wants to play at being Uncle Sam, and have a
postal system right in the house, or out on the front porch
where it will be convenient for the children next door to
enjoy it, too? Every small boy and girl loves to play
postman, collect mail from the toy mail-box, cancel the
stamps, sort out the letters into the proper routes, and
then deliver them to those whom they are addressed to.</p>

<p>The mail-box shown in <a href="#fig_325">Figs. 325</a> and <a href="#fig_326">326</a> is easily made,
and with</p>

<p><b>The Working Material</b> on hand can be completed in an
evening. Two sheets of cardboard, a piece of muslin,
some silver paper or paint, a piece of tape about 2 yards
long, and a needle and thread, are required. The cardboard
should be stiff enough to hold its shape, and yet be
of light enough weight to cut and fold easily. Sheets 22
inches by 28 inches can be bought at any printing-shop,
and at some stationery stores, and will not cost more than
10 cents a sheet at the most. If you have some large cardboard
boxes, however, you can use them instead by so laying

<p><b>Making the Sides, Ends, and Bottom</b> of the mail-box,
with the dimensions of every portion marked upon them.
Use a ruler with which to guide your pencil in drawing the
straight lines, and a compass or the rim of a 9-inch plate
for describing the arcs for the round tops of the end pieces.
You will see that the front, one end, and the bottom are
made in one piece, and that the back, other end, and a
second bottom (to make that portion doubly strong) are
cut from another piece.</p>

it on with flour paste.</p>

<p>After the paper or paint has dried, paste</p>

<p><b>A Collection Schedule Card</b> upon the front of the box.

they are shown in the illustrations.</p>

<p><b>Hang up the Mail-box</b> by means of its tape strap, within

<p><b>For a Mail-bag</b> use a school-book bag, or make one just
like a real postman's out of brown denim or cambric.
Letter "U. S. Mail" upon the bag with black paint, or
cut the letters from black or white muslin and glue them in
place. Provide a long strap to reach over the postman's
shoulder.</p>

<p><b>The Way to Play Post-Office</b> is for several children to
attend to the writing of letters and wrapping of parcels,
another to play mail clerk, who puts the post-marks on the
mail and sorts it out into "routes" and another to play
postman.</p>

<p>Canceled stamps from old letters may be re-used on the
play letters, and a rubber-stamp dater such as they sell at
the stationer's for 10 cents may be used for printing the
post-marks.</p>

<h3>A HOME-MADE REFLECTOSCOPE</h3>

</div>

<p>This reflecting lantern, shown completed in <a href="#fig_339">Fig. 339</a>, is more magical in
its operation than a magic-lantern is, because, instead of projecting
through transparent slides, it reflects opaque pictures. That makes it
possible to use magazine and newspaper pictures, post cards, and
photograph prints. You may reflect a greatly enlarged picture of the
movements of your watch, and by placing your face against the opening in
the reflectoscope, you may show a view of your
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
mouth opening and closing, giant size. The ease with which slides are
obtained makes this a desirable lantern to own.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="fig_341" id="fig_341"></a>

<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 341.</span>&mdash;Plan of Reflectoscope.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Material.</b> You must get a box about 10 by 10 by 20 inches in size for
the case of the reflectoscope, two oil-lamps, or two 16 or 32
candle-power electric lamps with the parts necessary for connecting them
to the electric lighting circuit, three 1-lb. baking-powder cans and two
tomato cans, two pieces of tin about 6 by 10 inches in size, and a lens
from a camera, field glass, opera glass, magic-lantern or bicycle-lamp.</p>

<p>The bottom of the box will be the front of the reflectoscope.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="fig_342" id="fig_342"></a>
<img src="images/i_252b.jpg" width="400" height="340" alt="Cross-section of Reflectoscope." title="" />
<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 342.</span>&mdash;Cross-section of Reflectoscope.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cut the Lens Opening</b> through this, at the center of its length, and a
trifle above the center of its width. Make the hole a trifle larger than
the lens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cut Ventilator Holes</b> 3 inches in diameter through the
uppermost side of the box, near to the ends and bottom.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_341">Figures 341</a> and <a href="#fig_342">342</a> show</p>

<p><b>The Interior Arrangement</b> of the reflectoscope. Place
the lamps in the corners of the box, next to the front, and
tack in back of them the pieces of tin for reflectors (<i>A</i>,
<a href="#fig_341">Figs. 341</a> and <a href="#fig_342">342</a>). Bend the reflectors to the curve shown.</p>

<p><b>If Oil Lamps are Used</b>, their tops will project through the
ventilation holes, as shown in <a href="#fig_342">Fig. 342</a>. These openings
must be inclosed with</p>

<p><b>A Hood which will Conceal the Light</b>, yet allow the heat
to escape. The most satisfactory arrangement is that
shown in <a href="#fig_339">Figs. 339</a> and <a href="#fig_342">Fig. 342</a>. A baking-powder can with
its bottom removed (<i>B</i>) is slipped over the lamp chimney
and fitted into the ventilation hole; then a tomato-can
(<i>C</i>) is inverted over the top of the can and fastened in the
slotted ends of three wooden peg stilts (<i>D</i>, <a href="#fig_340">Fig. 340</a>), and
the pegs are fitted into holes made in the top of the box
(<a href="#fig_339">Figs. 339</a> and <a href="#fig_342">342</a>). Fasten the can in the slots of the
stilts with tacks (<a href="#fig_340">Fig. 340</a>).</p>

<p><b>If Electric Light is Used</b>, the hooded ventilators may be
omitted. Any boy who understands the wiring of electric-lamp
sockets, plugs, and drop-cord will know how to wire
up the reflectoscope.</p>

<p>Mount the Lens in a can or mailing-tube jacket (<a href="#fig_343">Fig. 343</a>).
If you use a can, remove the bottom. If the lens
is smaller in diameter, make a band of cardboard strips to
fit around the edge, as shown in <a href="#fig_344">Fig. 344</a>, and glue these
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
strips to the inside of the can or mailing-tube. The lens
jacket should fit loosely enough in the reflectoscope box
opening so it will slide back and forth for focusing. Make a
tin collar to fit around the jacket, and tack it to the front
of the box, to prevent light from escaping (<a href="#fig_339">Fig. 339</a>).</p>

<p>Before putting on
the back of the
reflectoscope box,</p>

<p><b>Putty up all Cracks</b> between the boards in the top and front, to
make the box light-tight; then</p>

<p>=Paint the Inside of the Box= and the cover boards with lamp-black
thinned with turpentine, so there will be no reflections other than
those produced by the lamp reflectors and the picture.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 346.</span>&mdash;Detail of Post Card Holder.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Nail the Back Boards in Place</b>, leaving an opening about
7 inches square directly opposite the lens. Cut a piece
of board to fit this opening (<i>E</i>, <a href="#fig_345">Fig. 345</a>) for</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Picture Holder</b>, and hinge it in place. A frame for
post cards to slide in should be fastened to the picture
holder, as shown in <a href="#fig_346">Fig. 346</a>. First nail strips <i>F</i> to board
<i>E</i>, then tack strips <i>G</i> to them so their edges project over
strips <i>F</i>. A little wooden button (<i>H</i>, <a href="#fig_345">Fig. 345</a>) will fasten
the holder board shut while each picture is being projected.</p>

<p><b>The Lens Reverses Pictures</b> in projecting them, and in
order to have them projected right-side up on the screen it
is necessary to slip them into the holder frame upside down.</p>

<p><b>Adjustments.</b> After you have built your reflectoscope,
you may find it does not throw sharply-defined images upon
your projection screen. In that case you must readjust the
focus of the lens, the curve of the lamp reflectors, and
the distance between the lens and the projection screen,
until the best possible results are obtained. Inasmuch as
the positions will vary with different lenses, it is impossible
for me to give any hard and fast measurements. You
will have to determine the distances yourself.</p>

<p>The stronger the light, the brighter the projected image
will be; therefore, use the strongest light you can get, and
place the lantern not more than five feet away from the screen.</p>

<p>Unless you use an anastigmat lens such as the better
grade of cameras are fitted with, you will discover that the
corners of pictures are indistinct when you have brought
the centers to a sharp focus. This indistinctness can be
corrected to a great extent by blocking out the holder to
curve the post cards and other pictures so that the ends
are closer to the lens than the center is.</p>
